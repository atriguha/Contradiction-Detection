134,402,20,2,"Yes.  I would have to say I can't recollect, obviously, like I said, two years ago, but I would assume that I probably would have tried to call him and could not get through.  That's why I sent him an email.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
135,408,20,8,"When you say you give him a heads-up, that was for what purpose?",q,MR. DOSS,start_answer

152,453,22,3,Any of the sidewalk where?,side_chat,MR. BAUMBERGER,start_question
153,456,22,6,Let me put it this way:  You told us you didn't have any issues getting in. There's a mention here about not shoveling the end of the sidewalk.  I presume from what you have already testified to and the way this email is phrased that some portion of the sidewalk was clear.,q,MR. DOSS,start_answer
154,463,22,13,"Yes.  Because at the end of that, it says ""to get to the clear sidewalk.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
155,465,22,15,"Do you remember where in the parking lot itself it was slippery?  You make a statement in parentheses at the end of that second sentence:  ""(which is very slippery still),"" and I'm trying to figure out when you were referring to that or when you had that information.  If you know sitting here today.",q,MR. DOSS,start_answer
156,473,22,23,"That would be the blacktop because I'm stating that ""everyone has to walk through the parking lot,"" which would be the blacktop portion where you would park on, ""is very slippery.""",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
157,479,23,4,"When you're saying ""slippery still,"" when are you talking about?",q,MR. DOSS,start_answer
158,481,23,6,When I was coming in that morning.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
159,482,23,7,"So you're not talking about, like, sometime after she fell.  You're talking about when you came in that morning?",q,MR. DOSS,start_answer
160,485,23,10,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
161,486,23,11,You didn't make any calls after coming in that morning to anybody or to Mr. Anstine before this call at 8:00 -- or this email at 8:04; is that correct?,q,MR. DOSS,start_answer
162,490,23,15,"Like I said, this was two years ago, so I can't say for certain, but I would assume out of my typical habit I would have tried to reach out to him via phone and then sent the email.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
163,495,23,20,"Right.  But I'm talking about your earlier testimony that, when you first came in that day, you did not call anyone because you didn't have any problems coming in. Is that correct?",q,MR. DOSS,start_answer
164,502,24,2,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

171,524,24,24,"To the best of your recollection, what time did you arrive that particular morning?",q,MS. SHERLOCK,start_answer
172,528,25,3,I do not know.  It would have been before 8:00 a.m. so I could have been at my deck at 8:00 a.m. and been able to answer calls.  But I don't know what time I actually arrived at the office that day.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
173,533,25,8,"Exhibit No. 2, Anstine 2, in front of you, was an invitation to the accounting firm's customers to an event that day that was going to be from 8:00 to 9:00, and it indicates the doors would be open at 7:30 a.m., correct?",q,MS. SHERLOCK,start_answer

177,544,25,19,So is it fair to say you were probably there that day before 7:30?,q,MS. SHERLOCK,start_answer
178,546,25,21,Not necessarily.  I'm the receptionist.  And they would not come to where I was.  And there would have been other staff there as Tammy Ordway and so forth.  So they would have been welcomed and greeted by her.  I necessarily wouldn't have had to be there at 7:30.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
