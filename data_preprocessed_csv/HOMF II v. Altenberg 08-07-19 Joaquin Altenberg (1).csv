The guys that -- the Blue Sky guys were saying I was interfering with their business.  I said, No, I'm not.  Marc is an old friend. I just wanted to help the business. So we stepped back and said, We're not going to engage.  You guys do whatever it takes to get this deal done. Glad you're looking at it.  We're out. And so even though they financed it, they -- and they used our material, which we're fine with, technically, we never signed a contract with them, Blue Sky did. We let Blue Sky handle that process.
