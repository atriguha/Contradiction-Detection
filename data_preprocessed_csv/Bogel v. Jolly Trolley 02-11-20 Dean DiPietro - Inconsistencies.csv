So any question I give, any response you provide, any objections that are made, everything is going to be encapsulated for all time in a book and someone might need to go back and read that transcript.  To make that process easier for that person, I want to make sure that the transcript is as clear as possible. For that to happen, I'm going to ask us to take turns speaking.  Wait for me to give my full question before you give a response. I'm also going to ask you to give your responses in the form of words as opposed to saying uh-huh, uh-uh or shaking your head. Also, if at any time you don't understand a question being posed to you, let me know.  That way I can fix it in some way or do whatever I can to make it more clear, whether it be restate it, rephrase it or change it in any way. If you give me an answer to a question without first telling me you didn't understand it, I'm going to believe that you understood the question and that the response you're giving is to that question.

81,327,22,4,"Did you have a primary care physician before October 1st, 2016?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer

But my company changed insurance plans in the summer of 2016 and so I had to stop seeing that office generally and so I was sort of in limbo there for a while.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
83,338,22,15,"So you had to stop seeing a general care or a family doctor that was associated with the Washington Medical Group prior to October 1st, 2016 because your employer switched carriers or insurance?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
84,343,22,20,"That's right.  And honestly it was in August, so stop seeing I would put in quotes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

95,377,24,4,"Have you been hospitalized for any reason prior to October 1st, 2016?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
96,379,24,6,Yeah.  So I had my tonsils out and wisdom teeth out when I was younger.  And in I want to say 2009 I had a surgery on my wrist.  I had a puncture into this wrist here (indicating) and I had to get a nerve repaired.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
97,385,24,12,That was your right wrist?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer

101,391,24,18,What did you do?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
102,392,24,19,"It's kind of a fun story.  You'll all get a good laugh here. I was taking a nap on the couch and I kicked the lamp over in the process here.  And then I was very frustrated because it was one of Ceci's favorite lamps. I cleaned up all of the broken glass and was left with the piece that the lamp shade connects to.  And I was a little lazy.  The trash can was more full than -- you know, it was sort of full.  And I was trying to get this piece of metal to go into the trash can and I was trying to bend it.  And it was brittle and it snapped and it went directly into my wrist. So completely self-imposed. There were many different steps I could have taken to not have that problem.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
103,412,25,14,Okay.,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
104,413,25,15,"Maybe it's worth mentioning I had that surgery done at the National Hand Center, I think it's called, in Baltimore, which is where we ended up going for Ceci's finger.  That was the connection.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
105,418,25,20,"Got it. Had you ever seen any mental health providers prior to October 1st, 2016?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
106,422,25,24,"I've been trying to think about this.  I think the answer is no.  My parents got divorced when I was 11 and I think my brother and I went to like two counseling sessions, but it's the only thing that I can recall.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
107,429,26,6,"Have you ever been on any medication for any mental health concerns prior to October 1st, 2016?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer

109,435,26,12,Okay.  Who prescribes that?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
110,436,26,13,"Well, it had been Dr. Stephen Macedo.

And I've got Ceci and Yaron both on top of my thighs and I'm not sure if I can move my legs.  I'm just pretty sure that I'm paralyzed. And I take some time for people to get untangled from one another, so in that process I was evaluating my body. Is that what you mean here?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

179,626,34,3,Did you strike your head as a result of the accident?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
180,628,34,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
181,629,34,6,What did you hit it on?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
182,630,34,7,"I mean whatever was behind me.  So I don't know if that's the road, the road with that little piece of plexiglass, some aspect of the trolley wall. I'm not 100 percent sure. Whatever was under me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
183,636,34,13,Were you conscious when your head struck whatever it was that it hit?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
184,638,34,15,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
185,639,34,16,How do you know you hit something?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
186,640,34,17,"Well, I wasn't on that side of the trolley and then when I woke up I was.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
187,642,34,19,Did you see any physical manifestations of any head injuries at that time?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
188,645,34,22,I mean it would have been the back of my head so I don't think I could have seen them.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
189,649,35,1,What leads you to believe as you sit here today that you struck your head as a result of the accident?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
190,652,35,4,"Sorry.  Didn't I just cover that? So was the last answer not okay? We were on the one side and then I'm on the other side, so it would be impossible for that to happen without me making contact with the other side.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
191,658,35,10,"Well, like, for example, did you see any knots on your head or any gashes on your head?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
192,661,35,13,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
193,662,35,14,No?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
194,663,35,15,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
195,664,35,16,"And you don't have any personal recollection that you were conscious for striking anything on your head, correct?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
196,667,35,19,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
197,668,35,20,Okay.  Did you have any head pain after the accident happened?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
198,670,35,22,"Yeah.  I had a bad headache, I mean not immediately after.  The adrenaline is just surging.  Right? But yeah, I definitely had a headache later that day and then, you know, progressively worse over the next couple of weeks.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
199,678,36,5,You've said that your left wrist appeared to be knotting up on you at the scene of the accident.  Is that right?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
200,681,36,8,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
201,682,36,9,Was it bleeding at all or --,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
202,683,36,10,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
203,684,36,11,-- deformed in any way other than just what you could appreciate in terms of the swelling?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
204,687,36,14,The second thing you said.  Just what I could appreciate in terms of the swelling.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
205,690,36,17,At the time the accident happened did you hear any sounds or could you perceive any sounds that construed to you or indicated to you that you had injured yourself?  Cracks?  Crunches?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
206,695,36,22,"Yeah.  So it's difficult for me to back map this to the moment of the accident, but for weeks after I just kept coming back to this crack in my back and still until today.  You just remember a crash.  Right?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
207,702,37,4,But you personally can recall hearing a crack in your back at the time the accident happened?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
208,705,37,7,I recall thinking about a crack in my back each and every day after the accident.  I don't recall anything about the exact moment of impact.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
209,709,37,11,"So although you don't recall hearing the crack at the time the accident happened, it's something that you have recalled after the fact?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
210,713,37,15,Sure.  Yeah.  That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
211,714,37,16,"How about your low back, was your low back bothering you immediately after the accident?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
212,717,37,19,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
213,718,37,20,At some point you extracted yourself from the trolley.  Is that right?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
214,720,37,22,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
215,721,37,23,Did you stand up on your own?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
216,722,37,24,"It's possible that Ceci and I sort of helped each other up.  I might have grabbed on whatever was around.  Yaron was on top of me, so he may have helped me up. But, generally speaking, we made our way together to the exit.  It wasn't like I was on a stretcher or in a wheelchair or something like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
217,731,38,8,And you walked out of a location that you believe to be an exit for the trolley?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
218,734,38,11,"Well, I seem to remember like some sort of additional maneuvering required. It wasn't like you're stepping off a bus, for example. I remember Ken and Darrion were on the outside and offering hands and I feel like there was a step over or something, maybe it was a back window.  I'm sure looking at a picture you would know what exactly we went through. That's what I recall.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
219,745,38,22,Where did you go from there,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
220,746,38,23,"We really just sort of milled about on the highway for -- I don't know -- maybe 20, 30 minutes.  It could have been longer. I don't think I looked at a clock.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
221,751,39,3,"So milling about like wandering, walking around type of thing?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
222,753,39,5,"Yeah.  I mean I don't think I was any further than a hundred feet from the trolley at any point until I was on the shuttle, the bus thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
223,757,39,9,At any point did any EMT's come up to you and ask whether you needed any medical attention?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
224,760,39,12,"Yeah.  Pretty shortly thereafter the first EMT's on the scene were doing this like initial triage thing.  They were getting everybody a wristband.  It was green, yellow or red, like how serious are you. And I think, I think Kat and Lauren and Wendy, Wendy I think is her name, all got either yellow or red and I think almost everybody else got green.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
225,770,39,22,"Okay.  What's your understanding, if you know, what it means to have a green wristband versus a yellow or a red?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
226,774,40,1,"You know, similar to a traffic light.  Right?  There's opposite ends and something in the middle. I would guess red is call the helicopter, but I'm not sure thereafter.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
227,779,40,6,Was a helicopter ever called to the scene?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
228,781,40,8,Not to my knowledge.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
229,782,40,9,"And nobody ever received a red wristband, to your knowledge?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
230,784,40,11,I don't know.  I couldn't answer one way or the other.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
231,786,40,13,"You received a green wristband, which on the range of colors would be the least severe.  Is that correct?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
232,789,40,16,"Yeah.  Of those three for sure, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
233,791,40,18,"I think the question that I was asking, I want to kind of circle back to it. Did the EMT's ever come up to you and ask if you needed medical attention at that time?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
234,797,40,24,"I don't recall that question being exactly posed to me, but I do recall the triage so it must have been.  That's the best I could do there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
235,802,41,4,Did you ever ask to go to an emergency room in an ambulance?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
236,804,41,6,I mean Ceci's finger was pointing this way (indicating) so we needed to go there. Was it for me specifically or for her?  I don't know.  That's where we needed to go.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
237,810,41,12,How did you come to get to an emergency room?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
238,812,41,14,"We rode like a bus, like a shuttle sort of thing.  I think it was like a commuter setup, a commuter bus for the area.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
239,816,41,18,What were the circumstances under which you became the passenger on that shuttle?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
240,819,41,21,"So everybody was getting taken to get medical attention and they told us that there was not going to be any room for us at the Beebe place and so there was another vehicle that was going to take us to the Milford Memorial. And they told us that there were no more ambulances because all of the ambulances had been deployed for presumably others in the accident.  I'm not sure.  And so like it was the two of us, I think Sarah and an EMT and the bus driver got put on that shuttle and driven to Milford Memorial.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
241,834,42,11,The bus driver was on the shuttle with you?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
242,836,42,13,No. I'm sorry.  The shuttle driver.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
243,837,42,14,"Oh, okay.  So Mr. Dowd was not on the bus with you or the shuttle?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
244,839,42,16,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
245,840,42,17,So by the time you left in the shuttle the ambulances had already left the scene of the accident?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
246,843,42,20,I couldn't tell you for sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
247,844,42,21,"During the time frame after the accident but before you left in the shuttle, did anyone come up to you who had advised you that they had observed the accident such as a bystander or kind of a third-party witness to it?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
248,851,43,3,"Not me directly, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
249,852,43,4,"When you got to Milford Memorial Hospital, what happened next?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
250,854,43,6,"Well, there was like a pretty lengthy I don't know if you would call it triage or what process there.  I just remember like -- this is like a recurring theme as you're trying to get through providers throughout this whole process. It's like nobody wants anything to do with you once they hear it's an accident. So they were trying to get claim numbers from us before they would even see us despite the fact that we had insurance cards.  I remember there was a long discussion at that paperwork desk before we were able to even get back in there. They put one of these (indicating) cuffs on me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
251,871,43,23,"A collar, a cervical collar?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
252,872,43,24,"Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry.  A cervical collar on me. And yeah, I guess they set both Ceci and I up for X-rays.  I would have had my back X-rayed and then brought us back together where I think we saw Sparks, Sparks, Sean Sparks maybe, Mike Sparks.  I can't remember his first name.  Dr. Sparks there saw both of us together. And there was a lot of talk about what they were going to do about Ceci's finger so we can get into that if that would be helpful.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
253,886,44,13,"Well, tell me, at any point did anyone tell you the results of the X-ray to your back?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
254,889,44,16,"Yeah.  So he said, you know, ""I took a look at the X-ray and it looks okay.""  And he described what happened to me.  I will never forget this.  He said, ""It's as if you did an entire NFL preseason in one minute."" And I was like ""Okay.  But without any of the training, right?""  It was the weirdest thing that anyone has said.  So he didn't see the break, the compression fractures on the X-ray.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
255,901,45,3,"Oh, okay.  So you left Milford Memorial Hospital unaware that you may have broken certain vertebrae in your thoracic spine?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
256,905,45,7,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
257,906,45,8,Okay.  Did anyone do an X-ray of your left wrist?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
258,908,45,10,I think so.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
259,909,45,11,And what was the result of that X-ray?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
260,911,45,13,I don't think there was a fracture.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
261,912,45,14,Did anyone do a CT scan of your brain at that time?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
262,914,45,16,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
263,915,45,17,Did you tell medical providers that you thought you may have lost consciousness as a result of the accident?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
264,918,45,20,No.  I don't think so.  And we talked about this.  It's probably not correct to refer to a different deposition. I'm not sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
265,922,45,24,You can go ahead and just testify.,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
266,924,46,1,"Yeah.  So similar questions, you know, what's your name, who's the president, that sort of thing, did you lose consciousness, which is reflecting on kind of a crazy question because how would you know if you did?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
267,930,46,7,So those types of questions were also posed to you in addition to your wife?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
268,932,46,9,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
269,933,46,10,And were you able to respond to those questions accurately?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
270,935,46,12,"Yeah.  I believe so, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
271,936,46,13,At that time did you have any concerns that you were suffering from any problems with a concussion?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
272,939,46,16,That was not on my mind at the time.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
273,941,46,18,Were you prescribed medication by any of the doctors at Milford Memorial Hospital?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
274,944,46,21,Yes.  And I can't remember if it was a painkiller or a muscle relaxer from Dr. Sparks.  And it was filled that evening.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
275,949,47,1,Did you go to the CVS?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
276,950,47,2,"Yeah.  I think it was a Rite Aid actually, but yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
277,952,47,4,Did you take that medication?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
278,953,47,5,"I did, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
279,954,47,6,That evening?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
280,955,47,7,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
281,956,47,8,Did you continue to take that medication?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
282,958,47,10,"I did, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
283,959,47,11,How did you get back to the Airbnb?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
284,960,47,12,"We took I think it was an Uber, not a Lyft.  But if it's important we can find the records.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
285,963,47,15,No.,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
286,964,47,16,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
287,965,47,17,And did --,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
288,966,47,18,I'm sorry.  We took an Uber or a Lyft to the Rite Aid where we met up with Rita and Leo and they gave us a ride back to the Airbnb.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
289,970,47,22,"And once back there, were there other people in the home that had been on the trolley?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
290,974,48,1,Absolutely.  Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
291,975,48,2,"And do you recall conversations you may have had with them, if any, regarding the accident?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
292,978,48,5,"I would describe the scene in there almost as if it was like an ER or a doctor's office itself.  Right?  Everybody is sitting on the ground with an ice pack or holding their bandage or whatever it is. And it's one of these beach houses, so there's a big ol' family room a giant wrap- around couch or whatever.  So of course we were talking about the accident sitting around there, are you okay, hugging each other, crying, all that stuff.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
293,989,48,16,What can you recall or tell me about your wife's mental health condition to the extent you observed it that night?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
294,992,48,19,"I mean that whole night is like a blur.  It's a complete shock.  Nobody's okay.  Everybody has darkest red eyes, just tears everywhere and shocked that we're not dead.  Happy to be together. Ceci had a cast.  She was a mess, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
295,1000,49,2,Sorry.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
296,1001,49,3,"You guys drove home the next day, right?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
297,1003,49,5,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
298,1004,49,6,Were you present for when Stephanie Novak came over to the house?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
299,1006,49,8,"Yeah.  I think I saw Steph twice, on Saturday and Sunday. And a point of clarification for you.  So Saturday I think she came over to the house.  Actually, I'm not positive she came Saturday night.  I know some other guests from the wedding came on Saturday night, but I actually don't know if Steph did or not.  I'm not sure. Sunday there was a preplanned brunch for the wedding guests, which we did not go to brunch, but we did stop in and give her a hug and say --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
300,1019,49,21,So you went to the brunch location just to see her and say hello?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
301,1021,49,23,Exactly.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
302,1022,49,24,You didn't stay for any food?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
303,1024,50,1,"Correct.  We actually -- it was too much.  It was, you know, everybody who wasn't in the crash but was in the wedding was there.  And if you've ever been to a post-wedding brunch, it's like a raucous good time and that was not where we were. So I think four of us or maybe six of us went directly across the street and had a sandwich.  We had lunch at a cafe across the street, a sandwich I think is what I said a minute ago.  I remember there was a Ravens game on, so that's why I remember being there around 1:00 o'clock on a Sunday.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
304,1038,50,15,After having lunch did you leave at that point to go home?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
305,1040,50,17,"Yeah.  Because I remember we listened to a little bit of the game in the car, so this whole thing would have been between 1:00 and 4:00.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
306,1044,50,21,So you would have gotten back sometime later on Sunday?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
307,1046,50,23,That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
308,1047,50,24,What was the first medical appointment you had for yourself personally after returning home to D.C.?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
309,1051,51,3,"I think we saw Ms. Milward together and I think that was very shortly after. We would have to check the records for the exact date, but it would have been that week. And, again, this was a new place to both of us that was recommended by a friend because of their -- again, a lot of these places in D.C. have rotating doctors so you can get in kind of quick if you don't mind who you're seeing.  So they were able to see us right away and we saw her a few times and always together.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
310,1064,51,16,At any point did you tell Ms. Milward that you were standing on a trolley at the time that the accident occurred?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
311,1068,51,20,"I don't recall specifying sitting, standing, one way or the other.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
312,1070,51,22,"What recommendations, if any, did Ms. Milward have for you in relationship to any injuries that you conveyed to her?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
313,1074,52,1,"Yeah.  So my back pain was really bad at the time and I was sort of just really tight and bent over and no strength in my back and the pain like wasn't going away.  I think she put me on Flexeril as a muscle relaxant to try to help with that. And we had seen her a couple of times in the intervening days there maybe. And the pain wasn't going away, the back pain wasn't going away.  And so I ended up getting the X-ray from Milford Memorial because I was able to call them and I guess they mailed me a CD, which I brought into Ms. Milward or put in their portal or something.  And she noticed the comments on the X-ray, which I guess -- this was all new to me at the time.  I didn't know that this is how it works, but the on-call doctor is not necessarily the specialist. So the on-call doctor looks and sees if it's like broken in half or whatever, but then the X-ray specialist reads it later.  And then that specialist comments like yeah, there's probably a fracture here; I recommend a MRI. And so that was her recommendation that I go get that MRI.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
314,1103,53,5,Okay.  And you eventually did that on October 17th.  Is that right?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
315,1105,53,7,"That sounds right, but I'm not 100 percent sure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
316,1107,53,9,And at that point were you referred to an orthopedic doctor?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
317,1109,53,11,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
318,1110,53,12,Dr. Tannous?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
319,1111,53,13,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
320,1112,53,14,And were you recommended to him by Ms. Milward or someone else?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
321,1114,53,16,I don't think she gave me his name specifically.  I think that I needed to get the MRI and follow up with an orthopedic specialist is probably what she said.  And that place is right around the corner from our house and appointments were queuing up there so...,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
322,1121,53,23,So did Dr. Tannous review your MRI and discuss with you the results?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
323,1124,54,1,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
324,1125,54,2,And what's your understanding of what the MRI showed?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
325,1127,54,4,"As I understand it, it's called a compression fracture of my T11, T12 and L1 vertebrae?  Vertebrae, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
326,1130,54,7,"And what, if any, treatment did he recommend to you at that time for that condition?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
327,1133,54,10,So immediately like right there that day they put this crazy back brace on sort of the shoulders with all these different pull straps to tighten it.  And the relief of getting that thing on was just like instant validation for the pain that I had been feeling for like three weeks. Sorry.  That's not what you asked. He recommended that I wear that brace for a period of I think six to eight weeks and then gradually wean myself off of the brace and then start a course of physical therapy for my back.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
328,1149,55,1,All right.  Did you have to wear that back brace 24/7?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
329,1151,55,3,"No. I didn't have to wear it to sleep or shower, but I wanted to.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
330,1153,55,5,"Okay.  So you received the brace, were instructed to wear it for six to eight weeks?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
331,1156,55,8,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
332,1157,55,9,You didn't necessarily have to wear it to shower or sleep.  Did the back brace help with the pain?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
333,1160,55,12,Absolutely.  So much.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
334,1161,55,13,All right.,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
335,1162,55,14,"I mean I was having trouble getting out of bed.  Like I couldn't lay flat on my back and sit up.  I didn't have the muscle strength to do that or the back sturdiness, whatever it is.  I couldn't do that. I had to lean over, kick my legs off the side of the bed in order just to get myself up and out of bed.  And then as soon as you get that brace on, I could like stand up on my own.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
336,1172,55,24,Okay.  So your understanding was you would be wearing this brace for the next six to eight weeks and then would have to like undergo physical therapy at that point?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
337,1178,56,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
338,1179,56,6,Was there ever any conversation as to the potential need for surgery at all?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
339,1181,56,8,"He did not recommend surgery.  I don't remember discussing it.  I don't think we did. And his take was there's not a lot they can do for compression fractures. There's some weird experimental stuff where they are like squirting gel in your vertebrae but, otherwise, you just kind of let your back heal and then you should be good.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
340,1191,56,18,"Okay.  So after six to eight weeks you were able to remove or essentially stop using the back brace, correct?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
341,1194,56,21,Right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
342,1195,56,22,And at that point you then started doing physical therapy.  Is that right?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
343,1197,56,24,That's right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
344,1199,57,1,You went to MedStar PT?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
345,1200,57,2,"Yeah.  So two things.  One, there was some overlap with me wearing the back brace and me doing physical therapy.  It was sort of a wean yourself off of it kind of situation. And then I would say broadly about MedStar they have done a fantastic job of making you feel like you're at the same place every time and you're definitely not.  There's MedStar Lafayette, which also has -- like the MRI place is separate from the PT place is separate from the doctor's office. So I feel sorry for you guys of having to go through all of these records because there's like different billing offices that all have just the same front desk. So if you're going to ask me clarification on which specific MedStar, it's not even a location, but like which exact one, it's all over the map there for them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
346,1224,58,1,The records that I have show that you attended about eight visits of physical therapy for your back.,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
347,1227,58,4,"Yeah.  That sounds about right. And there was another course of therapy about a year later that hasn't made its way to the records yet, but it is mentioned in one of the write-ups in there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
348,1232,58,9,And was that also at MedStar PT?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
349,1233,58,10,"Yeah, the same place, the Lafayette Center.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
350,1235,58,12,"As of January 6, 2017 it was noted that you were pain-free with activity, had met all your goals and are okay for discharge. Do you agree with that?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
351,1240,58,17,"I wouldn't say pain-free, no, definitely not.  But if you mean pain-free like with activity?  I don't know if that means with activity. Our goals for physical therapy were to get me to be able to use my back again, or at least that was my understanding of the goals, and I was able to do that. And the exercises that I learned and the routine that I got into there was very helpful for me and it was something that I was able to continue on my own. The time commitment required to continue to take an hour out of the workday to go to physical therapy was not sustainable, but most of the time you go there and it's the same sorts of exercises and they're just sort of standing there with you.  There's not a lot that you can't do at home.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
352,1263,59,15,"Explain to me the progress that you made with your back over a course of months from October through the end of the year, meaning October of 2016 to the end of 2016.",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
353,1267,59,19,"Yeah.  So I mean first and foremost my primary focus during this entire period was Cecilia and helping her through everything.  So I'm not even sure that I focused on my injuries anywhere near the level I should have, so it's difficult. When I got into PT was like really the first time that I was even thinking about mapping my progress or anything like that.  I was just so happy to have this brace that I didn't have pain so that I could get her to all of the appointments that we had to get her to. And so October is fuzzy for me. Right?  And then November is fuzzy.  And then as we get into -- I don't know when PT starts.  Like mid-November I think is when I start to make a little bit progress because I'm actually paying attention to it and the time has passed enough so that the bones have healed enough and we can start to work on the muscles. It's sort of like you need the brace while you wait for the bones to heal but during that time all of the muscles die or atrophy in the process so then your next thing you need to do is get them back up to shape.",a,THE WITNESS,is brackets

355,1300,61,2,"When you stopped physical therapy at that point, early January of 2017, did you have periods of time where you did not experience pain in your back anymore?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
356,1304,61,6,"Yes.  Yeah.  It's not and it wasn't in January a 24-hour-a-day pain.  It's a pain that is triggered by a specific type of activity, and it's any activity that requires my back to independently support itself.  So the most common are standing at a counter for any reason, cutting vegetables, preparing food, whatever, doing dishes or gardening because your hands are sort of out in front of you with some tools.  Those are the most common and it's every time for those things.  Any time I'm doing any of those things for more than five minutes the pain is there, and that was the case in January 2016 as well. But what changed is I could actually get out of bed.  I could walk around without pain.  That was what we had got through in physical therapy.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
357,1324,62,1,"Okay.  So by January of 2017 you still experienced pain in your back, but it was more situational in nature, typically related to standing for a period of time?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
358,1328,62,5,"Yeah.  I wouldn't call it standing though.  It's really using my hands out in front of me, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
359,1331,62,8,All right.  You have already mentioned that you believe you sustained a concussion as a result of this accident. Tell me what symptoms you believe you had that were a result of that concussion and how long did they last for.,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
360,1337,62,14,"So, you know, everything is very much mixed up in the days and weeks after the accident.  And, again, like I said, my number one goal was focus on Ceci at the time. I think I was immediately out of work for maybe two full weeks or a week and a half before I tried to go back.  And that's when it really hit home for me, that first day back at work.  I was on a call and I just had no idea what anybody was talking about and it was like my time to comment because it was like my area and there was no comment coming.  That's when I knew that something was wrong. I had been having headaches. That could have been.  I don't know.  That could have been.  But I know now later that that was the concussion.  I had headaches. I had fatigue.  But it wasn't until I got back to work that day when I realized there was like something going wrong in my brain.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
361,1360,63,12,"So headaches, fatigue and some sort of cognitive deficit?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
362,1362,63,14,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
363,1363,63,15,Okay.  Tell me about your headaches.  How frequently would you get them back then in October-November 2016?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
364,1366,63,18,"Daily.  Certainly in October.  And I got -- that went away much faster than it did for Cecilia, so I'm grateful for that but sorry for her.  But certainly daily in the weeks right after the accident and then less frequently thereafter and I would say that headaches were not really a thing certainly in January.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
365,1375,64,2,Of 2017?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
366,1376,64,3,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
367,1377,64,4,"How about the fatigue, for how long did you experience fatigue that you related to the concussion?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer

369,1382,64,9,"The cognitive deficit that you've described, how long did you experience that symptom?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
370,1385,64,12,"For the rest of that year, yeah.  I mean it's not like it immediately turned off on December 31st or something, but those three months were bad.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
371,1389,64,16,But by 2017 you had noticed a significant improvement?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer

379,1404,65,6,And why did you go back?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
380,1405,65,7,For those pains that I've described.  I think you called them situationally.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
381,1408,65,10,Situational back pain?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
382,1409,65,11,Situational back pain.  There it is.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
383,1411,65,13,And how long did you go to physical therapy at that time?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
384,1413,65,15,"It was another like ten or twelve session course.  You know, they dole them out in chunks.  That's how the insurance works.  They're sort of driving the show there, not the practitioners.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

397,1445,66,22,Marital problems that you were having because of any conditions you sustained as a result of the accident.,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
398,1449,67,1,The problem wasn't our connection to one another.  It was symptoms that we were both experiencing independently and concurrently as a result of the accident.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
399,1453,67,5,"Tell me, if you would, in your words what type of emotional problems were you having following this accident that were caused by this accident?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
400,1457,67,9,"I mean the accident itself was completely traumatic and upended your life in every way.  And when you throw on all of the stress of dealing with all of the medical stuff on top of that, you know, we needed help.  And Ceci's finger pointing in the wrong direction was kind of the focus because it's right there and it's sort of obvious and that's what you need to do. And then so we're dealing with that and they got to put her under and she's got surgery and all that.  And then okay, maybe she's like in a cast and maybe I had the back brace and a diagnosis by then.  So it's like okay, the physical stuff is maybe under control.  Let's like try to go to work or try to do some normal stuff after that.  And it's just not anywhere near the realm of possibility. Right? So unable to function like a normal human being when it comes to just any -- I don't know -- any task.  I'm sorry.  I guess I'm not really answering as to emotions. We had I think tried to go to that -- we went to the Ren Fest.  It was like the wrong thing.  And maybe -- I can't remember what the exact trigger was, but there were a couple of things that we had tried to do that were sort of normal life things, going to work being one of them. And then I remember just being in the house and, again, it's difficult to understate the impact of this.  But Ceci, she's a different person for months, for months after this.  And she just sort of, she had this sort of empty look, empty look in her eyes and she just wasn't there and she looked at me and she said, ""My brain is not the same,"" just right out there super honest.  Not like I think this thing might be wrong with me or whatever.  Just like factually ""My brain is not the same.  I need to see somebody.  I need to talk to somebody.  It's not just my finger. There's something else going on here."" And that's what prompted us to try to get that appointment.  And either from him directly or from Ms. Miller -- I can't remember who -- it was also recommended to go see the concussion specialist.  And they're really hard to get and that's why we don't end up seeing them for a couple of weeks after the accident and it's just really, really hard to get those appointments. Ceci mentioned an appointment with Jessica Clark and she was able to get that evaluation that fall, but her full-day evaluation wasn't until April, but I scheduled it on like October 5th.  I mean it was crazy.  That's how backed up those people are.  I don't know if it's a D.C. thing or if it's everywhere or what. So that's what prompted us to go there.  We know we needed help.  Like we didn't know at the time that it was concussion related, emotional related, just trauma generally.  We needed help because we weren't normal.  We weren't living our lives normally.  I wasn't -- you know, you just don't cry every day.  That's not normal.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
401,1534,70,11,"Aside from those three visits with Therapy Group of D.C., did you see any other mental health providers associated with the accident?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer

403,1540,70,17,Right.,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
404,1541,70,18,"Mental health.  We're breaking that separate. So I would say no, I did not see any mental health professionals related to the accident or otherwise.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

409,1558,71,10,Okay.  So every time you're in a vehicle or a public transportation you feel increased anxiety?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
410,1561,71,13,"Yeah.  Absolutely.  It's a little bit better in my own car or on my own bike because there's some semblance of control here, which is a big thing that you don't have in the Jolly Trolley or any of those other types of situations, but it's ever-present any time.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
411,1568,71,20,Has that fear ever prevented you or restricted you from doing something that you would have otherwise done?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
412,1571,71,23,"Doing or enjoying to the fullest? I would certainly say that.  One of the most recent severe events was this past Thanksgiving.  Ceci had some family in town from California who we don't see all that often, driving just up to Baltimore.  It's 45 minutes from the house, but it's Thanksgiving day so traffic is a little bigger. And it's just one of those days when everybody is a little jammed up on the highways and a little crazy and somebody did something dumb, like cut over.  I mean Ceci's in a full-blown panic attack, tears. Like I wasn't sure if I should pull over or not.  It was that serious.  That has happened a lot since the accident, but never -- this was a particularly bad one. And then the whole rest of Thanksgiving was colored by that because she immediately called her mother afterwards and then her aunts and uncles are there and saying what's going on?  You know how family is sometimes.  So half of Thanksgiving was colored by this moment in the car there. I could talk forever about anxiety on transit.  If it's helpful, I can give some more examples.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
413,1602,73,4,That's okay.  Thank you. When is the last time you saw Dr. Tannous?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer

417,1613,73,15,That's fine.,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
418,1614,73,16,And that was one appointment with Dr. Tannous and he recommended the ten physical therapy sessions.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
419,1617,73,19,"Since having the X-ray at Milford Memorial and then the subsequent MRI with MedStar Imaging later that October, have you ever had any subsequent X-rays or MRI's to your back?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer

421,1624,74,1,"As you sit here today, do you believe you will need any subsequent X-rays or MRI's to your back?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
422,1627,74,4,"The way that Dr. Tannous put it for me was that my back is a different shape. I got to retrain the muscles to get used to the new shape and it's going to be a daily exercise that I'm going to deal with and there's going to be a period of my life where I'm able to work at it with yoga and exercises and everything and generally get close to normal.  And then he indicated that it's going to get a lot worse when I get older. Does that mean I need to get more X-rays?  I'm not sure.  He didn't say you will need more X-rays, but he said this often comes back later in life is basically what he said.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
423,1643,74,20,Did he say that within a reasonable degree of medical certainty?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
424,1645,74,22,I couldn't answer that.  He told me that so I trust that he said it with a reasonable degree of medical certainty.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

434,1675,76,2,Do you believe that this accident has precluded you in any way from advancing in your career?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
435,1678,76,5,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
436,1679,76,6,In what way?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
437,1680,76,7,"I mean it's not like there are clear promotion or career advancement opportunities that you're actively rejecting or not going for, so maybe not like discretely like that. But I spent a year of my life distracted and engaged in other stuff.  I spent two months like not even there and then I spent the better part of the next ten months just dealing with this, right, dealing with this for myself, dealing with this for my wife and not being present at work and my performance at work suffered, absolutely. There are a whole lot more titles left to get at my work, but I've gotten a promotion every two or three years since I started in 2006 and it sure hasn't changed since the one that I have now. Yeah, that's frustrating.  And I fell like being more present and engaged during that period would have been helpful for career advancement. So can I explicitly point to an explicit opportunity?  No. But do I think it had an impact?  Yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
438,1707,77,9,"How about on a more personal level, do you believe that the accident and any effect from the accident has played a role in delaying, postponing or even canceling any type of other types of opportunities in your personal life?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
439,1713,77,15,"Yeah.  So I would point to two here and the one that we already talked about a little bit, which is having children. Absolutely this had an impact.  Ceci and I had talked about that off and on since we were married and we've always said we will have kids since we first started dating. And we weren't actively trying before the accident, but there was no chance on earth that we were going to try for the next year at least.  And then when we finally did get around to starting, super personal, like over a year and a half ago, we had an awful time with it.  And I just can't help but wonder -- they keep telling us that age is a factor in conception success.  And I can't help wonder had we started three years earlier, at least you get 36 more tries, right, I mean if nothing else, right?  Whether or not it's less possible because I'm older, I'm not the one to say.  But 36 more tries would have been nice, right?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
440,1737,78,14,Okay.  You said there were two.,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
441,1738,78,15,"Sorry.  And the second is I am like a less active person, generally speaking, coming out of this accident than I was prior.  I was absolutely an avid cyclist prior to the accident and I would still consider myself a cycling enthusiast, but I haven't been on a single long ride since that accident.  And it was not uncommon for me to go five or six hours on a weekend, eighty miles or whatever.  I just love spending time on my bike. And it's not necessarily the back that has precluded me from that but it's just the over sense of fatigue and certainly for the first year there was so much going on in my life with all of the appointments and everything that we have to get to that there wasn't time for that sort of thing. I used to go rock climbing about two nights a week and that's the sort of thing that if you lose it, it's hard to get back.  Like every time you take a break, you come back and you never quite get to where you were and probably just because I'm getting older or whatever.  But I tried to go back to rock climbing in maybe February that following year and just didn't have the strength, was not having any fun with it and just brought all this screaming back -- streaming back to me that this used to be something that I did all the time and went on trips.  I've taken numerous overnight climbing trips, love it. And it stopped because of this.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
442,1775,80,2,And you were present for when your wife described some of the vacations that you both have been on since this accident. Are there any others that she may have forgotten to mention that stick out in your mind?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
443,1781,80,8,"No.  No.  I don't think so.  I mean I think once or twice we've gone somewhere for like one or two nights. We went to Kristlyn's birthday party in Virginia Beach.  We went to -- we tried to go to Yaron's and Lauren's wedding, which was canceled for a hurricane, but we got halfway, so a couple of those but that's about it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
444,1790,80,17,Okay.  I want to ask some questions about the accident itself. Do you need a break at all?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer

526,1995,88,22,"My best guess is Yaron, but I'm not 100 percent certain.  And I'm only guessing that because he was on top of me afterwards so that would make sense.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

543,2038,90,15,What can you tell me about the trip between the time you left the location you got on the Jolly Trolley and the next time the vehicle came to a stop?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
544,2042,90,19,"Very little.  It was not notable. It was just a couple of minutes.  I recall being with my friends going to a wedding and everything that comes with that and the place we were was not a part of that, if that makes sense.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
545,2049,91,1,Did you have any concerns or fears once you got onto the Jolly Trolley and could observe the structure of the trolley and the components of the trolley around you?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
546,2054,91,6,"When it pulled up before we got on it, there was a little bit of a moment where -- this is not a technical term -- but that's a little jenky was sort of what went through my head and it was just a quick flash.  But being so excited to be there with my friends, I never gave it another pause, never another moment's thought.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

551,2075,92,2,How many people would you say?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
552,2076,92,3,"I couldn't tell you the exact number.  I mean we know how many people were on the trolley, so I would say about a third of them got on at the second stop.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
553,2080,92,7,How many got on at the first stop?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
554,2081,92,8,"Well, two-thirds.  Two-thirds of 25 or 28, however many we are on the trolley. Can I guess 18?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
555,2084,92,11,"Okay.  When the additional people got on at the second stop, did anybody have to get up from their seat and stand in the trolley?",q,MS. COLE,start_answer
556,2088,92,15,"There was sort of a move back, everybody moved back and reoriented.  And I'm not sure if anybody was standing. I don't recall. I heard afterwards that people were, but I couldn't say that I recall seeing them one way or the other.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

560,2101,93,3,I don't recall.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
561,2102,93,4,And at some point after the individuals got on the trolley it started pulling forward again --,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
562,2105,93,7,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
563,2106,93,8,-- proceeding forward? Can you tell me what you can recall about the trip from that point forward?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
564,2110,93,12,"Yeah.  I mean -- and I wasn't like looking out the windows to know exactly where along the route we were, so I'm not going to have those details.  I'm sorry. But as the trolley began to accelerate, it became increasing aware that it was unstable and unsafe and problematic, bumpy, shaky, rocky and then eventually the sway. And the first sway there was a big laugh, like hey, this guy who made this dry wedding joke is having some fun with us and then the second sway or whatever number it was it's not a joke. And then they get progressively worse and then there's a moment where you know it's irrecoverable.  And -- sorry. Can you come back to the question?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
565,2128,94,5,Just a narrative of what you can recall about the trip itself from the point it proceeded from that stop to the time of the accident.,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
566,2132,94,9,"Yeah.  Okay.  So I mean I remember the fishtailing starting.  I remember it getting progressively worse.  I remember thinking very clearly -- I'm not sure.  I may have said it to Ceci.  I don't know. I remember thinking this is irrevocable because it was just getting worse and then I remember looking out the front and seeing the back end of the van, the tires were skidding.  Right?  So the momentum of the trolley as part of the sway was pushing the back end of the van such that the tires were sliding sideways on the road.  And that happened for -- I don't know -- maybe two times. I think the accident reconstructionist has looked at the skid marks I'm guessing, so we could probably figure out exactly where that was if necessary.  But I recalled that.  I remember the swaying getting worse and then I remember the swaying getting so bad that the van was, you know, the back of the van was moving as opposed to the front of it doing the steering.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
567,2158,95,10,So you could observe fishtailing in the van as well as part of the trolley?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
568,2160,95,12,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
569,2161,95,13,I know you recall potentially saying something to Ceci about it being unrecoverable with respect to the sway.,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
570,2164,95,16,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
571,2165,95,17,Did anyone else say anything to you?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
572,2167,95,19,"I don't have any recollection of anybody saying anything to me.  I've since heard a lot of people say a lot of things that they said, but I really don't remember any of that.  And that's not to say it didn't happen.  I just don't remember it, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
573,2175,96,2,Do you recall any efforts by anyone in the vehicle to try to make contact with the driver at that point when the swaying was occurring?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
574,2179,96,6,No.  I don't recall anything like that.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
575,2181,96,8,I know you've described essentially what kind of proceeded as like a movement back and forth that eventually progressed over time. Are you able to give me an estimate regarding the amount of time that that trailer was moving back and forth?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
576,2188,96,15,I would just say that it would have been long enough that none of the cars that were behind us on the highway hit us.  I do remember like a pretty crazy traffic jam almost immediately after getting out of that and so all of those cars must have had enough time to observe what was happening and back off and not screaming directly into it. I have later heard that we were swaying for about half a minute.  Was I counting or looking at a stopwatch?  I don't know.  A half minute sounds just right to me. Is that enough?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
577,2204,97,6,Okay.  Did you ever see any vehicles pass the Jolly Trolley as you were experiencing that swaying?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
578,2207,97,9,"Not that I recall, no.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
579,2208,97,10,Did you see any other vehicles swerve in order to try to avoid the Jolly Trolley?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
580,2211,97,13,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
581,2212,97,14,At any point was there any conversation that you were a part of or heard about later about whether or not anybody else who had utilized the Jolly Trolley on other trips that day had experienced something similar to what happened to you?,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
582,2219,97,21,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
583,2220,97,22,Tell me about that.,q,MS. COLE,start_answer
584,2221,97,23,"Well, I think we first learned about it through a comment on a news article.  It was either a news article or maybe on the Jolly Trolley's Facebook page. I can't remember.  One of those two. We were in the local news, the accident was.  I don't think it got picked up wider than that, but Delaware -- I don't know what the newspaper is called.  We were in one of those and so there was an article online.  It might still be up. And it was either in somebody's comments on that or a comment on maybe their Facebook page directly about another wedding that had experienced something similar and the people had somehow managed to get off.  And I've since learned that we talked to them and got some more details on that, but that's how I heard about it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

594,2263,99,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

So sometimes it gets fragmented into a bunch of different texts when somebody who's not on iMessage responds, if you guys know that.  It's a mess. But yeah, we were in constant communication prior to the wedding and we are -- sorry.  Constant is an overstatement but we are a close group.  We were close prior.  We are close after.

And he said I'll call you right back or I'll call you back in an hour or something.  And then I took the call on the stairs outside there of the hand center in Baltimore.

678,2531,110,8,I mean both the PT folks and Dr. Tannous and Dr. Anderson have told me it's okay to take ibuprofen for flare-ups.

Most frequently just prior to that I remember we had a bunch of friends over for dinner in -- gosh, I don't know. That was probably, that was probably November.  Actually, maybe that was in January. We had some friends over for dinner and I was doing the dishes and I just remember they were giving me such a hard time for doing what they called dish dancing.  It's because when I do the dishes I have to like spread my legs out so wide so I can keep my back straight and I was just really looking funny when I was doing that.

Sorry.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
768,2797,120,24,That's all right.,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer

807,2890,124,17,I remember coming to with my wife and Yaron on top of me.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
808,2892,124,19,What's the last thing you remember before then?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
809,2894,124,21,The back end of the van fishtailing.  I remember seeing the tires going the way that tires aren't supposed to go.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
810,2899,125,1,So you don't specifically have a recollection of it ultimately tipping over onto its side?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
811,2902,125,4,I mean I'm certain it happened but I do not recall flying through the air.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
812,2904,125,6,I didn't mean to suggest that you did.  I was just trying to figure out to what extent your memory goes to and where it picks up again.,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
813,2908,125,10,"Right.  So Ceci recalls it bumping something.  I don't have any memory like that.  I don't remember it turning over, flying through the air or anything like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

815,2917,125,19,I don't recall being aware of that. I've been made aware of that after but I don't think I knew that before.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
816,2920,125,22,Did you review the police report by chance at any time since the accident to see what the police officer recorded as what his interview with you consisted of?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
817,2925,126,2,"I've read the complaint and I think the police report is part of the complaint, but I'm not sure I saw all of the attachments so I'm not sure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
818,2929,126,6,Do you recall reading the summary of the interview with you before your deposition today?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
819,2932,126,9,"I didn't read it today but I have read it, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
820,2934,126,11,Have you read it in the last three or four months?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
821,2936,126,13,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
822,2937,126,14,I just have a few questions about what the police has put down in terms of what you allegedly told to him.  I'm just going to read from the police report.,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
823,2941,126,18,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
824,2942,126,19,"It says ""He"" -- and when it says ""he,"" it's meaning you -- ""He also explained that when the van started swerving back and forth it appeared as if the driver was trying to correct the situation by steering in either direction. However, the back end was still whipping out farther than the front."" Do you recall telling the police officer that?",q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
825,2953,127,5,Sure.  Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
826,2954,127,6,Do you recall that happening?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
827,2955,127,7,I recall the back end of the van moving.  At the time I presumed it was due to things that the driver was doing.  I since -- I don't know.  We've talked a lot more about this and learned about fishtailing trailers and the effect that can have on the vehicle in front.  And now I can't say for sure whether or not the driver was taking any actions to make that happen.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
828,2965,127,17,Were you able to see the connection between the van and the trailer as it was swaying?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
829,2968,127,20,Not that I can recall.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
830,2969,127,21,Do you have any knowledge as to whether the trailer became unattached from the van before it tipped over?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
831,2972,127,24,I don't have any knowledge one way or the other.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
832,2975,128,2,"Reading again from the police report, the police officer writes ""When asked about the wind, Mr. DiPietro replied the wind was definitely not strong enough to blow the trailer sideways.  However, he was unsure how the wind affected his steering."" Do you remember telling the police officer that?",q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
833,2984,128,11,Sure.  Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
834,2985,128,12,Can you elaborate on that statement at all?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
835,2987,128,14,"I mean if anybody has been there, there's always a little breeze coming off of the ocean.  But if it was strong enough to affect this trolley, it would have affected it each and every time they drive it.  So I don't think it was a big deal.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
836,2993,128,20,"The final sentence the police writes about the interview with you was ""In conclusion, Mr. DiPietro mentioned that when he boarded the trailer it appeared overloaded and the operator should have been able to activate the trailer brakes to try to control some of the swaying back and forth."" Did you tell the police officer that?",q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
837,3004,129,6,"I think so, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
838,3005,129,7,What made you think that the trailer appeared to be overloaded?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
839,3007,129,9,There are a few guys that were in the accident that have direct experience on farms or otherwise towing trailers and we spent a lot of time talking about what could have gone wrong and I think that's where it came from.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
840,3013,129,15,So that would have been in the day or two following the accident that you talked to those people?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
841,3016,129,18,Sure.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
842,3017,129,19,And who were those people?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
843,3018,129,20,"The first two that come to mind are Joe and Mitch, Joe Johnson.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
844,3020,129,22,And Mitch Stanton?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
845,3021,129,23,"Yes, and Mitch Stanton.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
846,3022,129,24,And what familiarity do you know that Joe Johnson and Mitch Stanton have with respect to farm vehicles?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
847,3026,130,3,"Two good stories here.  Joe Johnson used to be the head landscaper for a summer house in St. Mary's.  And I worked for him for a summer, but he did that for multiple summers down there so he's very knowledgeable.  That was a big, big property.  It's Ted Koppel's summer house. So you can imagine there were all manners of trailers and farm equipment and that sort of thing at that property. Mitch, I just know that he grew up on a farm, but I couldn't tell you the extent.  He's got a lot of John Deere clothing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
848,3040,130,17,"Did either Joe or Mitch mention to you that they believed that the trailer was overloaded, either at the time of entering into the trolley or after the accident?",q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
849,3044,130,21,"Certainly I don't recall anyone saying that as we were boarding or as we were on the accident.  And yes, we've talked about it a whole lot after the accident and now we have learned about the weight limits and everything else so it's all mixed together, but yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
850,3052,131,4,"And you told the police officer -- once again, this was only a couple of days after the accident -- that the operator should have been able to activate the trailer brakes. What did you mean by that?",q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
851,3058,131,10,"If it was possible to stop, he should have stopped.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
852,3060,131,12,What do you know about this vehicle and whether it had trailer brakes?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
853,3062,131,14,I don't know whether or not it did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
854,3063,131,15,Did you know at the time that you spoke to the police officer?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
855,3065,131,17,"No.  And Joe had speculated, sorry, that there were trailer brakes because there was some wires.  He recalled seeing some wires.  I didn't see any of that, but he recalled seeing some wires that he thought would have gone to brakes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
856,3071,131,23,"So, once again, is that information that you were relaying based upon your conversation with Joe?",q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
857,3075,132,2,"Yeah.  Sure, a combination of my own experiences and my conversations with others.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
858,3078,132,5,"Well, what's your experience with respect to trailer brakes?",q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
859,3080,132,7,I don't have any experience with trailer brakes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
860,3082,132,9,And what do you mean based upon your own experience?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
861,3084,132,11,I mean I was on the trailer. Right?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
862,3086,132,13,Right.,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
863,3087,132,14,So if there were brakes he should have been able to stop.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
864,3089,132,16,"I want to talk just briefly about your wife's injuries. From your perspective, how was your wife before October 2016 when it came to flying?",q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
865,3094,132,21,"Nothing like what she's like after, night and day.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
866,3096,132,23,I'm asking you what she was like before.,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
867,3099,133,1,"She was normal on planes.  I think any sane human gets a little nervous when there's turbulence on a plane and certainly she had that.  We'd hold hands on the plane, but she was fine. She was not like I can't get on a plane or I'm terrified the whole time on a plane.  We went on lots of trips together and that was never in the cards.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
868,3108,133,10,And are you saying that that's how she is now?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
869,3110,133,12,Those increased.  Sorry.  She was fine before.  She's not fine now.  That's what I'm saying.  If you need me to clarify something specific.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
870,3114,133,16,What are her limitations now on getting on planes and how does she manifest the problems that she has while she's on a plane?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
871,3118,133,20,"There is an ever-present dread whenever she's on transit of any kind, not just a plane, but it could be a train, a bus and especially when we're in the back seat of a cab or a Lyft or Uber or someone else is driving.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
872,3125,134,2,"You mentioned while you were sitting in the median after the accident the EMT's were giving green bands, yellow bands and red bands?",q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
873,3129,134,6,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
874,3130,134,7,Did both you and Ceci get green bands?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
875,3132,134,9,"As far as I can recall, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
876,3133,134,10,"In terms of Ceci's anxiety prior to the accident for which she was taking medication, can you describe for me what you saw in terms of her anxiety prior to October 1st, 2016?",q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
877,3138,134,15,"Yeah.  I mean the biggest symptom, the biggest manifestation of Ceci's anxiety is her sleep problems, like to a factor of 10 over any other symptoms that there might be. Ceci -- sorry, honey -- she's an overachiever and she's a rule follower, like won't even go to the order, to the pickup spot at a counter to order.  So she needs job and school and life to be going right and feels pressure to make sure that that's happening I think is fair to say. But her problems sleeping were so severe that she had to, just had to have that medicine.  I would sneak into her pill bottle after she got it refilled and take a couple and stick them in a Baggie in my sock drawer so that when we went on trips, even just to her parents for the weekend, I would bring a few with me in case she forgot because she would just not sleep and the whole weekend would be ruined. So that's where it mostly -- I mean she just couldn't sleep.  It started around the time that she had said earlier, which started during her grad school.  I forget the year.  And she just couldn't sleep without assistance.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
878,3167,135,19,Do you remember the counseling that she had with Christine Marr?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
879,3169,135,21,"I mean I didn't go.  I remember that she did go, but I wasn't there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
880,3171,135,23,What do you remember her telling you about that or did she not discuss it with you?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
881,3175,136,2,I don't think we got into too much detail about it.  She's just trying to get the sleeping figured out.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
882,3178,136,5,"In terms of your own ADD or ADHD that was diagnosed around 2009-2010, what problems, if at all, did that cause you from doing activities?",q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
883,3182,136,9,"Sure.  It was really about attention span, just having the shortest attention span, like easily distracted, scattered when it comes to planning, to do lists, ordering of tasks,. And then -- and I think that had always been ever-present.  I never was great at homework or any of that stuff in school.  And I eventually talked to the doctor about it and Dr. Macedo happened to be at that practice where I went whenever I got like the flu or something and they did the test there.  They got this test where you look at the screen and something comes up and you're supposed to press it when you see it and I was like in the 10 percentile or something.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
884,3200,137,2,And did it affect your decision- making?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
885,3202,137,4,No.  I wouldn't say I was making bad decisions because of this.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
886,3204,137,6,I'm not saying you were making bad decisions but your inability to make decisions.,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
887,3207,137,9,"There's some nuance there.  It's like the inability to pay attention and make the right to do list which affects decisions, but it's not like I'm making a decision that I would not have made. Does that make sense.",a,THE WITNESS,start_answer
888,3213,137,15,I'm not talking about making a different decision or making a wrong decision.  I'm talking about not being able to make a decision itself.,a,THE WITNESS,start_answer
889,3217,137,19,"To some extent, sure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
890,3218,137,20,"And by taking Adderall, did that assist with your decision-making process?",q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
891,3220,137,22,"Yeah.  Yeah.  That one's really hard for me.  I think it was really about attention and planning and structure, which decision-making is kind of wrapped up in.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
892,3225,138,2,Do you continue to take the Adderall?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
893,3227,138,4,I do.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
894,3228,138,5,"And has your dosage changed at all since the October 1st, 2016 accident?",q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
895,3230,138,7,No. I stopped taking it for like a month right after the accident at Dr. Delasobera's recommendation but then eventually got back on it.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
896,3235,138,12,Why did he recommend you stop taking it for a month?,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
897,3237,138,14,That's a she.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
898,3238,138,15,I'm sorry.,q,MR. BENNETT,start_answer
