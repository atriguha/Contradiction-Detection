First of all, your responses have to be verbal, yes, no, give an explanation.  You can't nod your head or say uh-huh or uh-uh, because they read the same on the transcript.

77,249,20,4,"All right.  As Chief Engineer and Director of Transportation -- Are Chief Engineer and Director of Transportation Solutions two different positions that you happen to have, or is it all combined into one person?",q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
78,255,20,10,"It's all combined into one person. At some point in the past, they were two separate positions that were combined.  The reason I carry both titles is because the Delaware Code requires DelDOT to have a Chief Engineer.  So, I am the designated Chief Engineer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
79,262,20,17,Okay.  What do you do as the Chief Engineer?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
80,264,20,19,"I sign contracts.  I handle, um, anything that would deviate from standard engineering practice.  Those would be the primary functions.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
81,268,20,23,When you say deviations from the standard -- Deviation practice?  Is that what you said?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
82,272,21,2,"Engineering requires a standard of care which involves following the standards and all the rules, regulations, guidance documents that deal with engineering. So, there are instances when my staff cannot follow those and they have to go through a process to get an exception or a waiver from a design standard.  So, they would prepare a document and submit it to me for consideration. And if they can make a strong enough case for an exception from a design standard, then I can approve that as the Chief Engineer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
83,286,21,16,"The design standards, though, that you're applying are engineering standards?",q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
84,288,21,18,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

88,296,22,1,That's true.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
89,297,22,2,"As the Director of Transportation Solutions, what is that and what do you do?",q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
90,299,22,4,"That would be personnel issues. The capital budget primarily for all of our projects.  Managing the capital program, any capital project that would be coming through, and then managing the operating dollars for my division.  So, that would be personnel costs, pens, papers, lights, travel requests, just managing staff, and handling everything that goes along with that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

96,321,23,1,"I do not know anything about insurance.  If anything, I've been told that we don't buy insurance and we don't -- we go to great lengths not to be named on insurance policies.  That's my understanding.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
97,327,23,7,Why do you have that understanding?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
98,328,23,8,"My understanding is that the State of Delaware has sovereign immunity, and if we buy insurance, it potentially jeopardizes that, that condition.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
99,332,23,12,And who told you that?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
100,333,23,13,"A Deputy Attorney General, more than one, over the years over my career.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
101,335,23,15,How would that come up whether or not there's been insurance in place in your job?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
102,338,23,18,"When I review contracts, there's often indemnification language in contracts.  And sometimes depending on who generates the contract, if it's an outside entity, they will sometimes either say that we have to indemnify them, or that we would name them on an insurance policy. So, I have taken those to our Deputy Attorney General and asked for their review and opinion, and that's what I've been told.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
103,350,24,5,Okay.  Are you familiar with the Dover Toll Plaza and where the bathrooms are for the public to use?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer

109,363,24,18,Okay.  Who would know that?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
110,364,24,19,It would be the Toll Operations Manager at DelDOT.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
111,366,24,21,Who is that?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
112,367,24,22,"That's a good question.  The person who had that job recently retired, and there's a new person and I don't recall the name.  I believe it's a woman, and it's in a different operating division of DelDOT. The Toll Operations fall under the Department of Motor Vehicles.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

114,377,25,7,Which is an operating division of DelDOT.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

152,439,27,19,That they don't have employees?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
153,440,27,20,Correct.,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
154,441,27,21,"So, my understanding is the Delaware Transportation Authority was established a very long time ago for the construction of the Delaware Turnpike, I-95, and that entity existed for quite a few years and was absorbed into DelDOT. So, any -- and I don't remember exactly when it was absorbed into DelDOT, but it's been a long time now.  If I had to venture a guess, it was probably in the 1990's. And when it got absorbed, all of those employees that were Turnpike Authority employees became DelDOT employees.  So, they don't -- The Transportation Authority exists in statute only but not as really an operating division.  They're just DelDOT employees.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

165,482,29,12,And what's that based on?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer

178,505,30,10,I reviewed what DelDOT's maintenance authority is on I-95 and I-295.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
179,507,30,12,And that's relating to the Delaware Memorial Bridge?  That's why you were looking at that?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
180,510,30,15,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
181,511,30,16,And what did you look at regarding that name?  What was the document called?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer

189,527,31,7,Great. Do you mind if we mark this as an exhibit to your deposition?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
190,530,31,10,I have no problem with that. Each side with the beginning and ending of the ramps that connect to I-95.  That is what I was told and that was what was marked on there.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
191,535,31,15,I see.,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
192,536,31,16,"So, I-295 comes over the Delaware Memorial Bridge, it makes a connection to I-95, but where the ramp -- you know, there's an on ramp and an off ramp.  So, where those ramps terminate, that's the boundary. So, DelDOT retains everything that's to the west of that point.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

203,573,33,3,I'm looking specifically as the interstate 95 and the highway 495.,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
204,575,33,5,That's correct.  We maintain I-95 and 495.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
205,577,33,7,"Okay.  On the other side of the line where you have written DRBA, that means that the Delaware River and Bay Authority is responsible for that side of the roadway?",q,MR. HEDRICK,start_chat

216,604,34,9,Do you know what she based where to put the line on?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
217,606,34,11,"It would be based on her understanding of our maintenance obligations.  So, I don't know if she has any separate documents that, you know, explain where that line falls, but the folks who work in maintenance understand where their maintenance and limits are. So, when I ask them where is the breakpoint, they tell me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
218,615,34,20,How did she describe the breakpoints so you would know where to put the line?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
219,618,34,23,"This is hers right here (indicating).  The DelDOT DRBA maintenance limits are at the end/beginning of the ramps to the Delaware Turnpike. And then the map itself was highlighted in red and yellow, but the red and yellow didn't come through when I printed it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

225,632,35,12,"I put the black line there, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
226,633,35,13,Did she review it after you put the black line?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
227,635,35,15,No.  The black line was simply because the highlighting didn't print.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
228,637,35,17,"Oh, I see, okay. But it's in the same place where the red line met the yellow line; correct?",q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
229,641,35,21,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
230,642,35,22,And that was explained to you by LaTonya that that's where the demarcation line is between what DelDOT's responsible for and what Delaware River and Bay Authority is responsible for; correct?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_chat

232,649,36,4,Correct.,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
233,651,36,6,Okay.  And in terms of -- You talked about maintenance.  What do you mean for the roadway?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
234,654,36,9,"Maintenance of a roadway would include plowing snow, patching potholes, sealing cracks, picking up litter, mowing grass, replacing down signs, repairing guardrail, and other traffic control devices on the side of the road.  That sort of thing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
235,661,36,16,"Other than telling us where the line is, can you tell me anything about the side that the Delaware River and Bay Authority is responsible for about how they maintain it, who they contract with, or anything about work that was done or being done on 295 either approaching the Delaware Memorial Bridge or on the Delaware Memorial Bridge at any time?",q,MR.

237,675,37,5,"Um, so, I don't, I don't have any knowledge.  I have knowledge about their bridge because they have to provide information to Delaware about the condition of the bridge that we pass through and give to the federal government.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
238,683,37,13,What makes them required to report the condition of the bridge to DelDOT?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_chat

242,694,37,24,"Sure. You talked about that DelDOT has to report the condition of the bridge -- No, that's not right. Delaware River and Bay Authority has to report the condition of the bridge to DelDOT.  That's what you testified to; correct?",q,MR. HEDRICK,start_chat
243,703,38,8,I object to the form. MR. McTAGGART,side_chat,MS. BURLEIGH,start_chat
244,706,38,11,"So, yes, they have to report their -- the condition of the bridge to Delaware.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
245,710,38,15,But my question is what requires that?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
246,712,38,17,"I believe it is a federal regulation, but I've not actually read the federal regulation that requires it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
247,715,38,20,Okay.  And what types of conditions are they required to report to DelDOT?  And they meaning Delaware River and Bay Authority.,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
248,719,38,24,"The information is standardized through the National Bridge Inventory, so there is an actual set of criteria that they have to report.  I don't know all of them off the top of my head, but they are typically the condition of the bridge deck, the condition of any steel elements. So, on that particular bridge, there would be suspension cables and the towers.  They would have to report on any structural element of the bridge, and it would include photographs and some assessment of, you know, a rating between zero and nine as to the condition, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
249,734,39,14,"Okay.  Let me ask a couple of questions in follow-up to that.  The National Bridge Inventory where's that located, or what kind of document is that in?",q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
250,739,39,19,"It's housed by FHWA, the Federal Highway Administration.  The data that Delaware keeps is in a computer program called AASHTO Ware, A-A-S-H-T-O, which is an acronym that stands for the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. So, AASHTO Ware is the software.  And within that umbrella software there's a subset called AASHTO bridge, and that's where it's held in that software.  It's a database.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
251,752,40,7,Does the National Bridge Inventory also dictate how often the Delaware River and Bay Authority is to report the conditions?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_chat
252,756,40,11,I object to the form.,side_chat,MS. BURLEIGH,start_chat
253,758,40,13,"I don't know if the inventory dictates it, but there is a federal requirement.  I would assume it's a federal regulation, but I have not read that federal regulation. But, my bridge inspection staff tells me what that frequency is, so I know what the frequency is for my bridges.  I don't know what the frequency is for that bridge.  It's not my bridge.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
254,769,40,24,Do you have any idea how frequently the Delaware River and Bay Authority report the conditions? Do you know what the frequency is?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer

256,778,41,8,Do you know what triggers their reporting requirement?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
257,780,41,10,"I believe it's just time.  It's, you know, at a certain predetermined frequency they are supposed to report.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
258,783,41,13,"So, every so often there's a schedule?",q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
259,785,41,15,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
260,786,41,16,"What if there's some event or problem that occurs, are they under a requirement to report that even if it doesn't fall in the schedule?",q,MR. HEDRICK,start_chat
261,790,41,20,I object to the form.,side_chat,MS. BURLEIGH,start_chat
262,792,41,22,"I don't, I don't know.  I know how we handle our bridges, and if there is an event that damages a bridge and the bridge is structurally compromised, then we do more frequent inspections.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
263,800,42,5,"The reporting of the conditions of the Delaware Memorial Bridge, who do those reports go to?",q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer

265,806,42,11,A-R-N-D-T?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
266,807,42,12,"Very good.  A-R-N-D-T, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
267,808,42,13,How long has he had that position?,q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
268,809,42,14,"I don't know, but it's been a long time.  Over five years.  It's been longer than I've been in my current position.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
269,812,42,17,"Okay.  When he gets the reports from the Delaware River and Bay Authority about the conditions of the Delaware Memorial Bridge, what does he do with them?",q,MR. HEDRICK,start_answer
270,816,42,21,"The information goes into our database, and then our database is reported to the Federal Highway Administration.  So, it's really just received and passed through.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
