41,196,8,5,Did you speak to anybody else at the scene other than Perdomo initially?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
42,198,8,7,"Well, once whatever witnesses were on scene -- there was a big crowd ended up gathering, because it was a -- it's a small-town area.

And then, as people showed up that were willing to speak to us, we spoke to them also.  But there was a couple of witnesses that I spoke to.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

52,222,9,6,"No, no, no.  No.  When we get there, we walk through the scene.  We ask them if any witnesses have been identified. We see what kind of physical evidence is physically there, as far as, you know, you visually can see it, to hold to preserve in case we can't -- you know, we can't walk control of the scene.  You know, sometimes the crowd, the people run through. And then just examining what we do have visually. Then, once Crime Scene gets there, we kind of walk through with them to do actually what the scene consists of and what we actually located, whatever evidence has been located by us or by responding deputies. And they do a more in-depth investigation.  Sometimes they will come up with some more, you know, find other things that we can't see visually on scene. And then we also start, once the detectives start to respond, then we start to spread out and look for witnesses and videos, things like that. So we kind of do that before we start talking to witnesses.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
53,249,10,8,Okay.  Do you have or are you able to state everybody who was spoken to by any detective or officer at the scene?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
54,252,10,11,"As far as I know, I had to hunt down a couple of the 911 callers through their -- from their CAD, the number they called from, that had left the scene. So I only know of Akerson, actually, I think stayed behind and spoke to a deputy initially. And that's where they initially got the first be on the lookout for the vehicle, from the witness that the deputies spoke to before we arrived on scene. I don't know of any other witnesses that they spoke to that gave any information that helped us or directed us in any direction.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
55,267,11,1,Okay.  And how was it that Ms. Akerson was -- came to your attention?  Was it from another detective?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer

57,272,11,6,"Okay.  All right.  And how was she pointed out to you, who she was?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
58,274,11,8,"I think one of the deputies said this is -- you know, yeah, she was there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
59,276,11,10,Okay.  All right.  And have you been able to review her statement to you?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
60,278,11,12,"I just have the synopsis of what she told me in the report. I don't have her -- I did review her statement, you know, a couple years ago, but not recently, the actual transcript.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
61,283,11,17,"If you would, for the record, give us a synopsis of what she told you?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
62,285,11,19,"Yeah.  Yes, I can.  But I'm also going to have to refer to what I wrote.  Okay?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
63,287,11,21,Yeah.  Yeah.,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
64,288,11,22,"All right.  She is -- Consuelo Akerson is a 911 caller.  She is in the neighborhood. It's on the 200 block or the 150 block of 6th Avenue, NW 6th Avenue, Dania. She sees a pickup truck parked on the sidewalk swale kind of deal, one half on, one half off. Hears shots.  Sees a black male running, get into the passenger side of a vehicle, and the vehicle leave. She describes the vehicle to the initial responding deputies, who put out the initial BOLO for the vehicle. And she describes it as a dark-colored F150 pickup truck with a lot of body damage.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
65,304,12,13,Was she able to indicate how many people were in the vehicle?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
66,306,12,15,"No.  She just said that the guy that ran, from when she heard the shots, where she saw the black male running, he got into the passenger's side. So, obviously, there would be a driver, at least one other person in the car, from the information that we had.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
67,313,12,22,Did you get any description of the person running?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
68,315,12,24,"No.  No.  She only was able to describe the victim, who she knew as CJ from the neighborhood.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
69,319,13,3,Okay.  All right.  Ultimately --,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
70,320,13,4,"I'm sorry.  She did describe -- she did describe, referring to the report, a clothing description, but not -- couldn't tell you who it was or any physical description, just clothing.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
71,325,13,9,Ultimately you came to believe that possibly a gentleman by the name of Dontre Anderson was in the vehicle; is that right?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
72,328,13,12,"Um, it looks like later we learned that Dontre Anderson had been in the vehicle prior to the shooting. The first time we learned about him -- I don't know if you want to get into it now -- but he gave us information about Arvis Brown, you know, prior to the murder, what he saw him possess and do. And we learned later on that he was in the vehicle, but I still think it was prior to the actual shooting.  I don't know -- I don't think it turned out that he was in the vehicle at the time of the shooting, but he was in that vehicle prior.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
73,343,14,2,So let's break it down just a little bit. How long after December 25th did you first become aware of any information that Dontre Anderson might have been in the vehicle at anytime during that day?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
74,349,14,8,"Um, I don't think we learned about him being in that vehicle -- we learned it through Michael Kelly, and I think that was after the second interview with Michael Kelly that put him in the vehicle, if I'm not mistaken. And that would be after the second murder, the second set of shootings.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
75,356,14,15,Okay.,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
76,357,14,16,But we interviewed Michael Kelly on this case.  And the information from Michael Kelly was that it wasn't so much a Dontre Ander -- it was that Arvis had the vehicle at some point.  He had lent it to him. The story had changed later on when it was reinterviewed after the second murder.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
77,364,14,23,"Well, let me say this:  At some point you had a strong suspicion that Dontre Anderson may have been involved in the shooting; is that right?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
78,369,15,3,"Well, just -- well, yeah.  There was information from people in the neighborhood that, you know, the gun was at the house there, that he was involved, that other people were involved. You know, Arvis's name came up, you know, five minutes after the shooting. So we were getting a lot of information, but it was hard to verify any of it. We did go and interview him and his brother.  And I think we did look at -- were able to get to go into the house. You know, we couldn't verify any of the information that we actually were getting from different sources about his involvement.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
79,385,15,19,Was his brother there?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
80,386,15,20,"Demerius, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
81,387,15,21,Demerius or Derrick?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
82,388,15,22,What is it?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
83,389,15,23,"Well, I saw in the report it said Derrick, but --",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
84,392,16,1,"Yeah, I don't know.  Darrius, Darus, Demerius, something like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
85,394,16,3,Did you ever physically speak to him?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
86,395,16,4,I didn't.  One of the other guys did. I think Curcio did.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
87,397,16,6,Do you know if a statement was taken of Derrick?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
88,399,16,8,I'm not 100 percent sure.  Probably.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
89,400,16,9,All right.  So let me go back.,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
90,401,16,10,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
91,402,16,11,"You say that people in the neighborhood were giving you information, and that may have included -- we are talking about, you know, that Arvis may have been involved -- but also that included that Dontre Anderson might have been in the vehicle at some point that day?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
92,409,16,18,"No.  I didn't have any information that -- I didn't have any information of who was in the vehicle that day.  I mean, later on in the investigation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
93,413,16,22,Go ahead.  I'm sorry.,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
94,414,16,23,"Yeah.  That day, I didn't know who was in the vehicle except, you know, the person that Akerson saw running to the passenger's side was obviously the shooter, and somebody was driving the vehicle. Once we learned who the vehicle belonged to and who might have been driving it, which would be the cousin, Kelly, we were able to get ahold of -- find the vehicle and interview him and learn what we learned from him on reference to the first murder investigation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
95,426,17,10,Was Michael Kelly the first source of information to indicate that Dontre Anderson may have been in the vehicle on the day that Christopher Jordan was shot?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
96,430,17,14,"Yes, but that came after the second murder.  That was in Curcio's investigation when him and Hayes, when they went up to Pennsylvania and interviewed him.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
97,434,17,18,"Yeah, we're going to try to get that off the screen.",side_chat,MR. FRANKEL,start_chat
98,436,17,20,What is it?,side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_chat
99,437,17,21,"Well, we got a pop-up of some sort.  It wanted to know if Peter wanted to marry an Asian woman.  (Laughter)",side_chat,MR. FRANKEL,start_chat

101,443,18,2,"So I didn't know Dontre -- as far as I know of Dontre being physically in the vehicle, we didn't learn that until after.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
102,448,18,7,"So what I wanted to make it is none of the people at the scene that day gave any information, as far as you know, to any law enforcement that Dontre Anderson was in the truck at anytime during the day that Christopher Jordan was shot?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
103,454,18,13,"Not that I know of, not the initial interviews.  I wasn't aware of that on the 25th.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
104,456,18,15,Okay.  The first time you became aware of Dontre Anderson was through Michael Kelly?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
105,458,18,17,"No.  We went -- we spoke to -- no, Dontre Anderson and Michael Cunningham came into the office. We had spoken to them as part of this investigation and then took statements from them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question

110,470,19,4,You said Michael Kelly.,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
111,471,19,5,"All right.  Yeah.  So we did speak to him. So I knew of Dontre Anderson.  I couldn't put him in the -- I didn't put him in the vehicle, Michael Kelly's vehicle at that time when we spoke to him.  He was spoken --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
112,477,19,11,When did the name Dontre Anderson ever come to your attention?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
113,479,19,13,"It would be during the initial investigation the first day or so, um, probably that night, because we did -- we did interview -- I did take statements from Cunningham and Dontre Anderson. They both came into the office, our office.  So, you know, their names -- their information -- their names came up early.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
114,487,19,21,"Okay.  And do you know what that information was, why they were asked to come in to make a statement?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
115,490,19,24,"No.  I reviewed my report, and I just have in there that we took statements from them. And I consulted with one of the other detectives. And I don't know if they came in voluntarily.  No, we didn't force anybody, but I can't remember when, how we came upon them -- I have been trying since yesterday trying to remember -- without speaking to them directly.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
116,500,20,9,"When you say that we took a statement from Matthew Cunningham and Dontre Anderson initially, were you part of those interviews? Actually, I don't think you were, because on the telephone call interview you said, ""I wasn't in the room.""",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
117,506,20,15,Yeah.  The statements were taken --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
118,507,20,16,So --,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
119,508,20,17,"No.  Hayes took statements, and I'm not sure who else took a statement.  I'd have to see.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
120,511,20,20,"Okay.  Do you know whether or not Mr. Anderson was a suspect, when he came in to give that first statement, in any way of being involved in the shooting of first degree murder?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
121,515,20,24,"No, we didn't have any -- we didn't have any -- even Arvis wasn't a suspect.  I mean, we didn't know or have anything saying, you know, that he actually did it at the time. So, no, on these statements, they weren't, you know, um, custodial statements, Miranda statements.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
122,523,21,7,Right.  Okay.  Do you know what the dates that Dontre Anderson and Matthew Cunningham came in to give their statements to Detective Hayes? And I'm not trying to trip you up.  I just don't think I really know.,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer

131,543,22,2,"All right.  But, according to you, you did not become aware of the fact that Dontre Anderson might have been in the truck at anytime on the day Christopher Jordan was shot until Michael Kelly was spoken to; correct?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
132,548,22,7,"As far as I recall, yes.  Because, as I said, Dontre Anderson gave us this information to help us get the arrest warrant for -- the initial arrest warrant for Arvis, but he didn't put himself in the vehicle, or we couldn't put him in the vehicle.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
133,554,22,13,Right.  But I just want to take it in order.,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
134,556,22,15,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
135,557,22,16,Were you part of the investigation in meeting with Michael Kelly?  And I think maybe you met with his dad first?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
136,560,22,19,"Well, we -- yeah, once we identified the vehicle and located it, we went down to Miami and made contact with Michael Kelly and his father and the vehicle, and they were cooperative.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
137,565,22,24,Right.  I think even Dad was willing to come back and talk about it; is that right?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
138,568,23,2,"They did.  They did.  They came back, gave statements, and let us take the vehicle.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
139,570,23,4,"And when you spoke to Michael Kelly initially, didn't he deny having been in the truck that day?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_chat
140,573,23,7,"Are you talking about Junior or Senior, if you could just clarify?",side_chat,MS. BANDELL,start_chat

143,577,23,11,Everything now is in relation to Junior.,side_chat,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
144,579,23,13,"Yeah.  No.  Junior said he was in the truck. I think what he said initially was that he got -- you know, Arvis wanted to borrow the truck.  He got the truck. And then Arvis dropped him off at his girlfriend's house or somebody's house, and then Arvis left with the truck.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
145,587,23,21,Okay.  All right.  So let me rephrase that.  He denied being in the truck at the time Christopher Jordan was shot?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
146,590,23,24,"Correct.  That's his initial, the first interview, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
147,593,24,2,Which would mean that he could not have been the driver of the person who jumped in; right?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
148,596,24,5,"Well, if you believed him, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
149,597,24,6,Right. And would it be a fair statement to say that you maybe had questions about his voracity during that statement where he said he was not in the truck at the time of the shooting?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
150,603,24,12,"Um, the story about, you know, a guy like Arvis offering him $50 to rent his truck to use it, I'm sure Arvis could get ahold of a vehicle, if he wanted to, to use it for to kill somebody. But the kid had no criminal record, and he was in college.  And I understand him not being forthright initially with us or putting himself away from the crime like most, you know, people do. But because of the reputation of his cousin, and if he was in the vehicle, he saw his cousin just kill somebody; so I don't think I would, you know, say I was with him either. So I understand if he didn't tell us the truth initially, but it's possible that he wasn't there, you know, when we first talked to him.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
151,622,25,6,"Well, really what I want to know is your state of mind.  In speaking to him, you had questions about whether or not he was telling you the truth about whether he was in the truck at the time the shooting happened?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
152,627,25,11,"That's correct.  Yes, that's fair.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
153,628,25,12,"Okay.  All right. And did he mention Dontre Anderson at all during that first interview, either on or off tape?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
154,632,25,16,"I don't think so, no.  Not the first time. We learned later on that Dontre was in the vehicle with all three of them.  But not -- at that time, I don't think so.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
155,637,25,21,"Okay.  And how did it come about that Michael Kelly, did he ever ultimately tell you that he was in the truck at the time the shooting took place?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
156,642,26,1,"Not to me.  But that was part of the probable cause, that when we reinterviewed, that's what he told Curcio.  And when they reinterviewed him with some more evidence, he did say he was in the truck when the shooting occurred.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
157,648,26,7,Okay.  And was it at that time that he also indicated that Dontre Anderson was in the truck?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
158,651,26,10,"During the second investigation when Curcio spoke to him, when he spoke to him a second time, I think that's when we learned -- that's at least when I learned that Dontre was in the vehicle. But I don't believe that Dontre was in the vehicle -- he said Dontre was in the vehicle at the time of the shooting.  I think it was just prior to it. But it was definitely the three of them were in the vehicle at some point together before the shooting, as far as I know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
159,663,26,22,"And at some point you made contact, or using the -- or having the information that Hayes received from him initially, you made a decision to recontact Dontre Anderson?  Is that right?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
160,669,27,3,"Can you say that again, Dave?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
161,670,27,4,You spoke to him on the phone?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
162,671,27,5,"Yeah.  We had everybody come in probably a second or third time to clarify things as we learned it.  It's pretty common. So, yeah, we brought him -- he came -- yeah, we did call him, and he came back in.  And we did take another statement from him.  And we also wanted him to look at some -- at the vehicle.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
163,679,27,13,Well --,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
164,680,27,14,Go ahead.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
165,681,27,15,"From what I remember, at least a statement that I have, it was on the phone that you spoke to him first?  He was in Cocoa Beach.",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
166,684,27,18,"Yeah.  I don't know where he was. Yeah, probably.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
167,686,27,20,"Okay.  All right.  And I assume that you followed up with him at that point because he had been placed in the vehicle, at least at anytime, relevant to this case; correct?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
168,690,27,24,"Yeah.  He was placed -- yeah, eventually he was placed in the vehicle.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
169,693,28,2,"Right.  Okay. In looking at the statement that Dontre Anderson gave you over the phone, it says on the transcript dialing and then ringing, and the first indication is an answer hello, that being him. And then it says, ""Hopefully, I can hear you better on this one."" It appears that you had spoken to him earlier and had to call him back?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
170,703,28,12,"I don't remember, but it's not beyond the realm.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
171,705,28,14,"Okay.  Do you know if there was any recording done of the first time that you spoke to him, or, if you recall, was it simply we have a bad connection, I'll call you right back?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
172,709,28,18,"Most likely, that's all it was. What did you say the first time around before the bad connection part?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
173,712,28,21,"Do you recall whether or not there was a tran -- you spoke to him such that you recorded anything of the first conversation when you may have had a bad connection, or was it very short and simply I gotta call you back on a different phone?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
174,719,29,3,"No, I would have documented if we had a conversation with him prior and then a second conversation, so it probably was a bad connection.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
175,723,29,7,And do you have a copy of the transcript of the telephone call you had with him?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
176,726,29,10,"No, I don't.  I don't have access to any of the stuff anymore.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
177,728,29,12,Okay.  I'm sorry.  All right.  I will read you what I need to and --,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_chat

179,732,29,16,Yes.,side_chat,MR. FRANKEL,start_chat
180,733,29,17,"I couldn't bring my whole file to Ricky, so I figured that the statements could kind of speak for themselves; so I gave him the police reports, and we reviewed some of the photographs.",side_chat,MS. BANDELL,start_chat
181,738,29,22,I understand.  That's fine.,side_chat,MR. FRANKEL,start_chat
182,740,29,24,All right.,side_chat,MS. BANDELL,start_question
183,743,30,2,In the statement on the telephone --,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
184,744,30,3,Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
185,745,30,4,"-- you did say -- and maybe we were wrong in our memory -- ""everything that you told me just a little while ago, that's all the truth, so let's -- let's go on."" Is it possible that maybe you did have a conversation with him prior to -- or that is not recorded and transcribed?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
186,752,30,11,"It's possible.  I mean, we talked to a lot of people.  That might be that maybe I didn't swear him in, and so sometimes at the end, if I forget to swear them in or something like that, I'll tell them is everything you told me the truth, or it could have just been -- I don't know who would have -- where the tape came from anyway.  I mean, who taped that?  Did we tape that?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
187,761,30,20,"Yes, it looks like it.  It's a transcript.",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
188,763,30,22,Oh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
189,764,30,23,"I do see in here that just before that, you do say, ""Even though we are on the phone, I got to swear you in.""",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
190,768,31,2,"Okay.  So it was a control call.  It was basically -- okay, it was a telephone interview.  I got you.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
191,771,31,5,Right.  So it's probably nothing different than when you speak to somebody --,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
192,773,31,7,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
193,774,31,8,"-- and you go over some preliminaries with them, get some preliminary information, and then go on the record?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
194,777,31,11,Correct.  Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
195,778,31,12,"You said to him, ""All right.  Now, you told them about a gun, and it had -- I think you said it had a brown handle."" Do you remember who ""them"" was that you told ""them"" about a gun?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
196,783,31,17,"Probably -- no, I don't know who he is talking about. What had happened, I think the day after the Jordan, Christopher Jordan was shot, he got his house shot, Dontre.  That's how we got him.  Dontre got his house shot up in a drive-by, but nobody got hurt.  And he called the police to report it. Um, and then I think they automatically knew who it was. Now, I initially thought that Dontre and Arvis were all friends, but maybe they had a falling out or something. But I don't know.  I can't say that Arvis was the one that accused of doing the shooting. But he had gotten his house shot up, and that's why we were over there to begin with, went over there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
197,803,32,12,"And this was the home on Pippin Way, P-I-P-P-I-N, Way?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
198,805,32,14,"Pippin, correct.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
199,806,32,15,"All right.  So ultimately what became important was that he, Mr. Anderson, said that early in the morning he saw Arvis Brown come and leave a gun in the bushes in front of the house on Pippin Way.",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
200,811,32,20,"Correct, and retrieve it later on.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
201,812,32,21,Did he indicate to you anything of any other detail other than seeing Arvis Brown do that?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
202,815,32,24,"No.  He saw Arvis with a gun in his waistband, um, at some point later on. And I'm not sure if he is the one that heard him sing -- I don't know if it really matters -- but it was some about singing some kind of retaliation song.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
203,822,33,6,That was Matthew Cunningham?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
204,823,33,7,"Matthew Cunningham, yeah, one or the two of them. No, I don't know if he -- what do you mean, like describe the gun?  Is that what you are asking, anything else about the gun?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
205,828,33,12,"Well, he just describes it as a brown handle; right?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
206,830,33,14,"Yeah, as far as I know.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
207,831,33,15,Did he say what he was doing when he saw Arvis come with the gun?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
208,833,33,17,"I don't believe so.  I mean, I only have a partial of his statement.  You know, I only take like a synopsis out of it and put it into my report. So without looking at the whole transcript, I don't know exactly what he was doing -- doing at the time when Arvis was -- when he said Arvis retrieved the gun, you want do know what Dontre was doing at the time?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
209,843,34,2,Right.,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
210,844,34,3,Probably just -- probably just hanging out.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
211,846,34,5,"And then let me ask you, he does say, or you ask him, ""Now, that story about your brother bringing Arvis over to your house, what's your brother's name, Derrick?  Yeah, Derrick.  Um, it was -- is that true that you told the detective that he came over there, that earlier in the day that Derrick brought him over there?"" Answer:  ""Well, yeah, that -- early that morning I guess Arvis called him and was like I want to come down there, you know, chill with you and, you know."" Okay.  Do you recall that now that I am reading it?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
212,860,34,19,"Not really.  I know that whatever happened with the brother really didn't pan out to anything, and I don't think that the brother ever drove him to the house there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
213,864,34,23,You don't think that was true?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
214,865,34,24,I don't recall how brown got to Dontre's house?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
215,868,35,2,Right.,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
216,869,35,3,"I'm not sure.  I thought it was on a bicycle. But I don't know -- I didn't interview the brother.  I don't know -- I don't think his involvement was much in this at all.  His name only came up once, I think.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
217,875,35,9,"Well, later on you did a warrant to arrest Arvis Brown for possession of firearm by a convicted felon; correct?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
218,878,35,12,Correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
219,879,35,13,And that was based solely on the statements that you had received or information you received from Dontre Anderson and Matthew Cunningham; correct?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
220,883,35,17,"That they witnessed him with possession of the gun, yeah.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
221,885,35,19,Did you ever issue a warrant for his arrest?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
222,887,35,21,"I did not. But later on there was a -- I guess a gun on a Facebook post that looked like it. But, no, we didn't recover the gun. As far as I know, we didn't recover the gun.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
223,893,36,2,All right.  And would it be a fair statement to say that you sought that warrant initially because you wanted to get Arvis Brown into custody because he had become a suspect in the shooting on the 25th and the 28th?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
224,898,36,7,"How do I put this?  Um, that was, um, after discussing the case -- after -- after, um, what I believed was all the evidence that we had at the time and the urgency, Arvis's -- the shooting the next day at Dontre's house and, you know, yes, we were concerned that he was keeping his word he was going to kill everybody involved with his brother's death, I thought, you know, with all the evidence we had gained up until this point before the shooting, Curcio shooting with the Cunninghams, I did present a case to -- I did meet with the state attorney, and that was the best route to take. So, yeah, we definitely wanted to get Arvis off the street. We couldn't -- you know, we didn't fabricate anything to get him off the street. We used the statement, you know, from whether you believe that their statements are, you know, what kind of witnesses they are, but they gave us sworn testimony that they saw him armed, and that was enough to violate him. Would I have liked to see him arrested for murder at the time?  Yes, you know, but --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
225,923,37,7,"But it's a fair statement to say at that point you didn't have probable cause for the murder, so you --",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
226,926,37,10,That's debatable.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
227,927,37,11,-- were looking for probable cause on anything to get him off the street?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
228,929,37,13,"That's -- no, I'm not.  That's debatable. I mean, the standards are different between law enforcement and, you know, the State Attorney's Office on what probable cause and how much it is to, you know, go get an arrest warrant for a murder, first degree murder. So the standards are pretty high these days, you know, at the time. So I would have liked to get him off the, you know, charged with murder initially, but a part of the bigger strategy, I guess, was to, you know, violate him this way.  But yeah, ultimately yes, get him off the street, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
229,944,38,3,"And, by the way, what would be the difference between probable cause for the police and probable cause for the State Attorney, as far as you understand that?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
230,948,38,7,"Um, I guess, you know, law enforcement doesn't always look at the bigger picture.  You know, we are in a hurry -- a lot of times we are in a hurry to do things, and we don't look at what it's going to take to, you know, to prosecute this person or is witnesses going to be cooperative, are they even going to be around, are they going to, you know -- So, I mean, it's a matter of opinion, I guess, and then policy. You know, I didn't go to law school. I didn't go to law school.  I, you know, went to the police academy. So, you know, I know what probable cause is.  You know, different jurisdictions do it different ways. A lot of places don't have judges sign arrest warrants, and prosecutors never look at them.  So it's a whole different, um --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
231,968,39,2,"All right.  And in relation to the prosecutor, I think what you are saying is the prosecutor's decision, if they make it on whether to arrest somebody, may include things more than simply what the information you had; it may be will this person be around at some point, is there conflicting evidence, that kind of thing?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
232,976,39,10,"Yeah, right, and the evidence, itself, you know, with what we perceive as evidence, you know, we can argue, and they say no, legally it's not, or this statement is, no, we can't use this statement because of this reason. So, like I said, I didn't go to law school.  They did. So, you know, once you meet with them, we come up with a different, a better strategy on how to deal with some of these perpetrators. And in this case it was let's get the VOP warrant, because that will, you know, at least get them in custody while we let, you know, forensic evidence come through and things like that.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
233,992,40,1,"Okay.  So let me jump back to what Mr. Anderson told you on the phone, that his brother was bringing Arvis over to hang out. That's what he told you; right?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
234,996,40,5,"I don't remember the conversation.  If that's what the transcript says, then, yeah, that's what he told me.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
235,999,40,8,"Yeah.  And just so we are clear, the question was but you didn't have a phone that night -- or wait -- let me -- now, the story about your brother bringing Arvis over to your house -- what was your brother's name, Derrick or something? Yeah, Derrick. Is that -- was that true you told the detective you came over there earlier in the day, that Derrick brought him over there? Answer:  Well, yeah, early that morning he, I guess Arvis, called him and was like I want to come down there and, you know, chill with you and, you know. So the information that Mr. Anderson was telling you, true or not, was that early that morning his brother brought Arvis over to chill out with Dontre; correct?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
236,1018,41,2,"If that's what he said.  I mean, it doesn't really mean anything to me whether he did or didn't.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
237,1021,41,5,"Well, wouldn't that be inconsistent with his story that Arvis put a gun in the bushes and then left?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
238,1024,41,8,Dontre said that.  Not his brother. Right?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
239,1026,41,10,"Right.  Dontre said that Arvis came over, put a gun in the bushes, and left.",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
240,1028,41,12,"Well, I don't know that the brother didn't bring Arvis over there.  I mean, I -- I --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
241,1031,41,15,"Okay.  But my question is Mr. Anderson had told you that Arvis came over, however he got there, put a gun in the bushes, and left.",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
242,1034,41,18,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
243,1035,41,19,And came back later and picked it up in the evening.  Right?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
244,1037,41,21,Okay.  Yeah.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
245,1038,41,22,"And but here he is telling you that his brother brought him over because Arvis wanted to hang out with him, he wanted to chill with him.  He didn't say that he left.",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
246,1043,42,2,"If you say so.  I mean, I don't know what you are -- I don't know what to tell you. I mean, if he -- well, the reason he came over there, I don't know what the reason was, if the reason was he came to hide a gun or to hang out with them. I don't know if I asked him did he stay, how long did he stay, or did he leave immediately. Maybe he did hang for a little bit and then leave.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
247,1054,42,13,"Well, in preparing more for Arvis's arrest, you have to make sure that the information you put in there is credible; is that right?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
248,1058,42,17,"Right.  And I can only go if it's credible by someone swearing that they are telling the truth. And if we are able to verify and vet some of the information, that will be great. But if, you know, they decide to lie under oath, there is nothing I can do about it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
249,1065,42,24,"But if there is an indication that the person may not be telling you the truth, like there is an indication that Dontre Anderson may not be truthful about actually seeing Arvis Brown putting a gun in the bushes, that would be important; correct?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
250,1072,43,6,"That's correct.  But I don't know that the reason that his brother came over to hang out or not to hang out or how long he stayed there had anything to do with his credibility to me. I mean, he wasn't -- I don't think he was being deceitful with me saying that his brother dropped him off and then left a few minutes later or stayed longer.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
251,1081,43,15,"Well, and I just want to drill down on it.",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
252,1083,43,17,Okay.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
253,1084,43,18,"If Arvis was coming over to hang out, that would be inconsistent with Arvis putting a gun in the bushes and then leaving?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
254,1087,43,21,"No.  He could have used the coming out to hang out as an excuse to go over to the house to hide the gun over there. He could have told them I want to come out and hang out, not let them -- not telling them ahead of time I'm coming over to your house to hide a gun, I'm coming over to hang out and, while I'm there, I'm going to hide a gun, but I'm not going to let them know. I don't think he wanted -- Arvis wanted to tell everybody he was hiding a gun there.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
255,1100,44,9,"So I just want to make it clear, at the time you spoke to him on the phone, he is potentially a suspect because he is in the truck that day; correct?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
256,1104,44,13,"No.  No.  Um, no.  He wasn't -- Dontre wasn't a suspect.  I didn't have -- in my case, Dontre, I don't think, was ever a suspect that, you know, that we could show that he was in the vehicle. I couldn't show he was ever in the vehicle during the first two days of this investigation.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
257,1112,44,21,"Well, let me ask you:  During this investigation -- during this statement, he denied ever being in the truck the day that Christopher Jordan was shot; is that correct?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
258,1117,45,1,"Correct, yeah, I believe so.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
259,1118,45,2,"And that would be inconsistent with the information that Michael Kelly gave you, that he was in the truck the day of the shooting?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
260,1122,45,6,"Right, but Michael Kelly gave that information later on after the second murder. I'm not involved -- see, I wasn't involved with the second murder.  I was only involved in the first two or three days of this Christopher Jordan case up until the fact when we got the arrest warrant for him, so I'm not --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
261,1129,45,13,Let me go back.,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
262,1130,45,14,Go ahead.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
263,1131,45,15,Didn't you previously testify here that you only found out about Dontre Anderson being in the truck at all the day of the shooting from Michael Kelly?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
264,1135,45,19,Right.  I wasn't aware that -- I wasn't aware that anyone put Dontre Anderson in the truck prior to the second -- Kelly giving a second interview.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
265,1139,45,23,"Okay.  So at the time that you speak to Mr. Anderson on the phone and he tells you that he wasn't in the truck at all, that would be inconsistent with the testimony that Mr. Kelly had given you?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
266,1145,46,4,"I interviewed -- do we have the date on the phone conversation, when that occurred?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
267,1147,46,6,"I don't because, again, it starts off -- the first thing on here is just you saying --",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
268,1150,46,9,"See, there is nothing -- Dave, there is nothing that --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
269,1152,46,11,-- hopefully I can hear you better.,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_chat

272,1158,46,17,"I apologize, Dave.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
273,1160,46,19,I guess the question is do you know the date that you had this phone call with Mr. Anderson?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
274,1163,46,22,"No, it's not -- it's not documented in my report, me speaking to him on the phone.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
275,1165,46,24,"You said it was after you had spoken to Mr. Kelly, the second statement by Mr. Kelly, where he does put Dontre Anderson in the truck?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
276,1169,47,3,"Okay.  So, yeah, so this phone conversation with Dontre might have been to clean up stuff, but it was nothing to do with the first investigation. It all -- anything to do with this second, the phone conversation, would have been -- that's why it's not in my report. It might be in Curcio's report, because this is all after the second murder, the second round of shootings, so --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
277,1179,47,13,"But what I am driving at is ultimately you do an arrest warrant or affidavit for an arrest warrant for Arvis Brown, as we have discussed. You have to rely -- when you hand that to the magistrate, you have to at least vouch for the credibility of the witness statement in the warrant.  You wouldn't want to give the magistrate information that you believe might not be true; correct?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
278,1189,47,23,"Correct, but I don't know of any information that was inconsistent at the time I did the warrant for his arrest. I don't think that this phone conversation you're talking about came at that time.  I think it came afterwards, after the second round of shootings.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
279,1197,48,6,"Well, we have two.  I mean, the first one --",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
280,1199,48,8,"The first statement was that he had the gun in his possession in his waistband before the murder and hid the thing. That's the only information I based my information on, is what his first statement was to me about when Dontre was at his house, Arvis is at his house, hides the gun and retrieves the gun, and he sees him with the gun. But, other than that -- so I don't have any reason to believe it's inconsistent.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
281,1209,48,18,Did you at anytime consider the fact that Dontre Anderson could have been making that up?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
282,1212,48,21,"I'm sure, yeah, I'm sure he could have made -- everybody in this whole case could have been lying, could lie. I mean, I don't know.  I mean, it's possible that he left things out.  Sure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
283,1218,49,2,"And it appears that he, you know, when he tells you that he was not in the truck that day, that is completely inconsistent with what Michael Kelly says; correct?  Michael Kelly said he was in the truck --",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
284,1223,49,7,"Right, but that --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
285,1224,49,8,-- but Anderson says I wasn't in the truck?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
286,1226,49,10,"Again, but my probable cause to arrest, based on his consistency or inconsistency, was prior to that conversation. I didn't know he was in the truck. So was he leaving that part of it out? When he said that Arvis hid the gun and didn't hide the gun, did he leave out the part that he was in the truck with Arvis at the shooting? Apparently, yes. But I had no reason to believe it was inconsistent at the time when I interviewed him and took his statement, the first statement.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
287,1238,49,22,"Okay.  I just -- I don't want to belabor this. Now, you told me that the first time information you had that Dontre Anderson was in the truck was when Michael Kelly said Dontre Anderson was in the truck; right?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
288,1245,50,4,"Yeah, I believe so. I don't believe I knew of any -- of Dontre being in the truck until they put him in it, Curcio in the second murder, then Curcio put him in the truck. Unless I'm missing something, I don't remember him telling me he was in the truck.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
289,1252,50,11,"And during this interview on the phone, you are saying to him, to Mr. Anderson, people are saying you were in the truck.",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
290,1255,50,14,"All right.  But this is -- again, this is later on.  This is not during the first two days of investigation.  This is -- this is after the second round.  When was the statement?",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
291,1259,50,18,"It was after you had learned that information from Michael Kelly; correct? It had to be after -- you actually talked to Dontre Anderson on the phone after you spoke and received the information from Michael Kelly, because you're telling him here in the statement, ""People are putting you in the truck,"" and you got that information from Kelly?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
292,1268,51,2,"Yeah, I at least spoke to Kelly one time, the first interview with Kelly where Kelly denies he is in the vehicle. It's not until afterwards, after the second shooting is when Kelly admits to being in the vehicle and having -- puts Dontre in the vehicle with him at the time, you know, prior to the shooting, and puts Arvis in the vehicle with him.  That's when Curcio, I think, spoke --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
293,1277,51,11,"When you had this phone conversation, you knew that Michael Kelly had said that Dontre Anderson was in the truck; correct?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
294,1280,51,14,I don't -- I --,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
295,1281,51,15,"And I'm saying that because you say in here, and I'm reading, this is on page eight, ""They're saying you were in the truck, and you're not saying, you know, you're saying you were at your house, and they're saying you was in the truck when the truck was moving."" ""So either they're not telling me the truth or you're not telling me the truth, and all I want is the truth."" So my -- I guess my ultimate question to you is at the time you wrote the affidavit, you had reason to believe that Dontre Anderson was not being truthful with you?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
296,1295,52,4,"No.  I -- you know, again, I don't know when I spoke to, when this phone conversation took place, you know, before or after this affidavit was drafted.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
297,1299,52,8,"Well, based on the information you have given today, why is it now you believe that this could have been before anybody told you that Dontre Anderson was in the truck?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
298,1303,52,12,"You want me -- you're trying to, you know, attack his credibility as a wit -- as the first statement he gave me on the hiding the gun in the bushes. And I don't know when he, you know, he gave me -- he told me on the phone that he was in the truck or wasn't in the truck. I can only tell you that what he told me at the house, what he saw Arvis Brown possessing a firearm. Now, you know --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
299,1314,52,23,You didn't know whether or not that was true or he was completely lying?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
300,1317,53,1,"Well, we asked a lot of people whether they were in the truck or not, because we didn't know who the driver of the truck was. We only knew that Arvis was probably the guy that got in the passenger's side. Somebody was driving. We didn't know Michael Kelly existed in the beginning of the investigation. So we asked a lot of people that were assoc -- might have been associates of Arvis if they were in the truck or did anyone know if they were in the truck. And most of them said no. I don't know at what point -- you know, you want me to tell you that this conversation took place, and which it did, but when I thought he was not credible or not, because he didn't put himself in the vehicle. And he ultimately was.  But he was inconsistent at some point.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
301,1337,53,21,Do you have an obligation to make some evaluation of whether or not this person is being truthful when you put information into an affidavit to get a warrant?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
302,1342,54,1,That's correct.  But I'm not telling you that I did the warrant before or after I had this phone conversation with him.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question

311,1357,54,16,"In the beginning of the state -- on the taped statement, it should have the time and the date.

But his transcript should have it in the beginning of it what time it started.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
312,1365,54,24,"No, this one just starts with you saying, ""Yeah, hopefully you can hear me better on this one, because my cell phone in the building don't work so good.  All right.  Hey, Dontre."" And then there is never any indication here of when this statement is being taken.  Let me see if --",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer

320,1387,55,21,All right.  So maybe we can look at his statement.  Hang on a second.,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer

400,1586,63,20,"Well, I'm just trying to figure out what we are trying to conclude here. Dontre Anderson said that Arvis showed up sometime in the morning and left the gun in the bushes. And now we have Matthew Cunningham saying that at some point he was riding by the house, and he saw Arvis Brown lifting his shirt and showing a gun. And then you have Dontre Anderson saying that later in the evening, just before the shooting, about 7:00, Arvis Brown came back and retrieved the gun.  Right?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer

410,1619,65,3,"So in the middle of the day, unconnected to Dontre Anderson seeing him leave it and Dontre Anderson saying that he came back and got it, Matthew Cunningham is saying that he was standing in front of the house possessing it?  Would that be right?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
411,1625,65,9,"Um, it sounds correct.  I mean if, you know, um --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
412,1627,65,11,"And, um, not saying that all of that couldn't have happened.  But if he is possessing it sometime during the day, that would mean that he would have had to put it back somewhere so that he could come back and get it from the bushes later that day.",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
413,1633,65,17,I don't know.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
414,1634,65,18,Sounds a little odd; right?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
415,1635,65,19,"No.  I don't know.  I mean, I got two people at two different times seeing him with the firearm independent of each other. So, you know, is Arvis or anybody going to walk around with a gun on them in a small town like that when you're known by the cops?  Probably not. So hiding a gun and getting it when you feel like it is not out of the realm of possibility. Um, I don't know how they do -- you know, how they do it.  They don't always carry the gun on them.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
416,1649,66,8,"Okay.  All right.  So also looking at page three, the middle of the page, he says, ""My girl sending me to the bank.

430,1679,67,13,Yeah.  He said he saw the barrel; right?,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
431,1681,67,15,"Um, ""I saw the barrel,"" yes, that's what it says.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
432,1683,67,17,"Let me ask you, did that stand out to you a little bit that somebody would stick a gun in their waistband with the barrel pointing up towards their head?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
433,1687,67,21,I don't --,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
434,1688,67,22,I'm biting my tongue on that one.  (Laughter),side_chat,MS. BANDELL,start_chat
435,1690,67,24,"I don't think that's what happened, Dave.",side_chat,THE WITNESS,start_question
436,1694,68,3,"I mean, people who put a gun in their waistband usually stick it in so they can draw it out if they need it; right?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
437,1697,68,6,"That's how you do it. No, I mean, he might have been able to see more than just the handle of the gun. It's pretty much an automatic. So him seeing the barrel could be he means the slide. I don't think he actually probably meant the barrel, the round part that's underneath the slide. You can't see the barrel if the gun is out, unless you're looking down the front of it being robbed, so --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
438,1709,68,18,"Wouldn't it be crucial to ask him if this thing had a brown handle, the way Dontre Anderson described it?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
439,1712,68,21,"Um, probably, yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
440,1713,68,22,Okay.,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
441,1714,68,23,I'm just happy to get some information out of these people.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
442,1717,69,1,(Inaudible),q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
443,1718,69,2,Huh?,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
444,1719,69,3,"The song:  On page five he says he was singing low, he was singing low, and then a couple of lines down, like retaliation is a mother.",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
445,1723,69,7,Uh-huh.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
446,1724,69,8,"But then on page six he says, ""I didn't really hear what he was saying.  I was barely listening to him because, I mean, he had this thing on him."" So, I mean, how -- I guess I don't have to ask you about that.  I mean, he will either testify to it or not. But would it be a fair statement to say that this was not the strongest statement you had ever taken of somebody who said that they saw somebody with a gun?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
447,1735,69,19,"No, it's not Oxford.  These are street people.  They -- I believe if they seen a gun, they know what a gun looks like, they seen a gun. Now, can they tell particularly a water pistol and a real gun from a distance? Probably not. But they see guns every single day, and they handle guns mostly every single day; so I'm pretty sure when he said he saw a gun, he saw a gun. Um, as for the song, I don't know if he heard the word retaliation.  I don't even know whether he knows what retaliation means or he could spell it. But, I mean, Arvis might have said the word retaliation and put it in his head.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
448,1753,70,12,"When you talk about people like that on the street, in addition to seeing guns all the time, they also make up stories all the time, don't they?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
449,1757,70,16,"Well, I have interviewed people to a maximum degree that lied to me. So everybody, to benefit themselves or to distance themselves from a crime, will be inconsistent. Or some people really just don't remember every detail.  And so it's not really being intentionally inconsistent; it's just sometimes you have to remind them of things that maybe through a video or they don't remember. So not everybody, but most people are going to protect themselves and distance themselves from anything serious that they think is serious. And it's not uncommon that, you know, people don't tell you -- I mean, some people are smart, though.  They wait for you to ask them the right question, and they are not really being deceitful.  It's just well, you didn't ask us, so I'm not telling you. So it's really up to the investigator to ask the right question, also, like a brown Handle.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
450,1781,71,15,"Okay.  And would it, in fact, be a fair statement to say that you were really just looking for information to put in a warrant to get Arvis Brown in custody?",q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
451,1785,71,19,"No.  Then I would have brought him to the side and said make this story up, and it would have been a lot more detailed than what I have, if I was going to fabricate it.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
452,1789,71,23,I'm not saying -- I'm not saying you fabricated it.  It's just maybe you didn't look at evidence you had with the most critical eye.,q,MR. FRANKEL,start_answer
453,1793,72,2,"Listen.  The only evidence I had -- I would have liked to have a video of Arvis with the gun.  I don't have that. What I did have was two neighborhood people there that saw them at different -- saw him possess a firearm at different times of the day.  And that's it. And that's what I used.  And apparently it was enough for a state attorney and a judge to say it was enough probable cause to arrest Arvis. I would have liked a lot more infor -- evidence, but that's all I had. And, you know, it was two people at different times saying they both saw the same thing and with a gun. And they didn't say -- it wasn't like they were together and said we both saw him with a gun in his waistband. One said he saw him with a gun in the bushes, and one guy said he saw him with it possess it. So, you know, their stories were kind of, you know, consistent because they weren't consistent. I don't know if that makes any sense, but they weren't on the same page together.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

459,1830,73,14,You had mentioned earlier that you were only involved in I think it was the first two or three days of this investigation; correct?,q,MR. PATANZO,start_answer
460,1834,73,18,"Yes, after the 28th, after that evening when the second murder occurred, that was a different, um, different people involved. I mean, obviously Arvis, we believe, was involved in both of them, but different victims and different location, even though it was connected but it wasn't, different investigators.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
461,1843,74,2,You played no part in the investigation of the shooting of the child?,q,MR. PATANZO,start_answer
462,1845,74,4,"No.  No.  I went to the initial scene for -- because we were already out that night on this case, but nothing -- I didn't take any action and didn't -- I don't believe we did anything on that case. Most of the information I got that shored up our case was through Curcio and his investigation of the second set of murders, second murder.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
463,1854,74,13,"Okay.  When you said you went to the scene, did you go to the scene of the shooting of the eight-year-old?",q,MR. PATANZO,start_answer
464,1857,74,16,Yes.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
465,1858,74,17,Did you talk to any witnesses there?,q,MR. PATANZO,start_answer
466,1859,74,18,"No, no, no, no.  We just pulled up. They, you know, it was a big, a lot of people there.  We offered our assistance.  And that was it.  I really didn't -- I didn't -- it was Curcio was the lead detective, and we didn't do anything else.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
467,1865,74,24,"Okay.  As the lead investigator in the shooting of Christopher Jordan, what makes you believe the shooting of the child was connected --",q,MR. PATANZO,start_answer

469,1871,75,5,-- to your case?,q,MR. PATANZO,start_answer
470,1872,75,6,"I don't believe the child was the target.  I understand that the Cunninghams and/or, you know, only because Curcio knew about the 2011 murder of the brother, so he knew the back story. And this was all -- all this was retaliation through, you know, from the information Curcio gave us, of the John Brown murder. And they believed that Cunninghams were involved and that's why they were targeted. The kid was just in the way, but --",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
471,1884,75,18,"Who, based on what you learned from Curcio, who were the intended targets when the child was killed?",q,MR. PATANZO,start_answer
472,1887,75,21,"I don't know.  I mean, I only know that the shooting was apparently retaliation. One of the Cunninghams, whatever Cunningham was available at the time, I don't know if he was going after one specifically. I mean, Curcio would know it, because he did an in-depth investigation and knows all the players. I don't know who the players were or why they were shot.  I think a female got hit. The child obviously wasn't a target, but, you know, got hit. I don't know if that -- I think Matthew was the actual target or not.  But I'm not sure.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
473,1903,76,12,Do you have any evidence that Matthew Cunningham was involved in the shooting of Arvis's brother?,q,MR. PATANZO,start_answer

Um, I mean, the guys that worked the Dania substation have been there awhile and know all these families, because that's a small -- it's a small area and everybody knows each other. We worked the whole county, so I never had to work Dania.  So I didn't know of Arvis or any of the Cunninghams prior to this.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
