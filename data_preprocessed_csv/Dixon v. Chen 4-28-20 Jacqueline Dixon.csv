18,102,6,14,"As you know, we're doing this deposition over the phone which is a little bit unusual.  So I need to ask you just a few questions about where you're currently located and who might be present with you in your location. So are you at home?",q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
19,109,6,21,"No, I'm not.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
20,110,6,22,Where are you?,q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer

24,116,7,3,And you are on your cell phone in the car?,q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
25,118,7,5,"Yes, I am.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
26,119,7,6,Is there anyone present with you in the car?,q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
27,121,7,8,"No, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
28,122,7,9,"Ma'am, have you ever been deposed before?",q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
29,124,7,11,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
30,125,7,12,"Just a brief statement about this deposition.  The court reporter put you under oath and that would be the same oath that would be given to you if you were going to testify in a courtroom and, therefore, you're under the same requirements to tell the truth and to be under the same restrictions and obligations that a judge would put on you if he were to administer the oath. Do you understand that?",q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
31,136,7,23,"Yes, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
32,137,7,24,"And before we started, before I started asking you questions, the court reporter asked you about making sure we try not to talk over each other.  Since you've not had your deposition taken before, there are a couple of other rules that can be very helpful and I just want to talk to you about them for just a minute. The first rule would be, ma'am, please don't guess at any of the questions that I ask you.  If I ask you a question and you don't know, providing the answer that you don't know is a perfectly acceptable response to the question. There may be some times that I might ask you to estimate something in terms of the number of feet between your car and Mr. Chen's car, something along those lines.  And in that instance, I will specifically ask that you estimate, but otherwise please don't guess at a response. Is that agreeable?",q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
33,160,8,22,It's agreeable.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
34,161,8,23,"Thank you. The other rule is that we're really just getting your knowledge. Sometimes it's human nature if you suddenly can't remember a particular date or a particular color or something of that nature that you want to ask someone else who might know the answer, but in this instance we really want to limit your responses to your own knowledge. Is that agreeable?",q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
35,173,9,10,It's agreeable.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
36,174,9,11,"Thank you. The next rule is if I ask a question and you're not sure that you heard the question correctly or you didn't understand the question, please ask me to repeat it and I'm happy to restate it so that when you give an answer we know that you're attempting to answer the question that I ask. When we get the transcript of this deposition back and we read my question and we read your answer, we have no way of knowing whether or not there was any confusion on your part so we have to assume that you were answering the question. So for any reason if you want me to repeat or rephrase the question, I'm happy to do that. Okay?",q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
37,195,10,7,All right.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
38,196,10,8,"Lastly, ma'am, is there any reason that you know of that would prevent you from being able to proceed with this deposition? For example, are you on any medication or under any conditions that would prevent you from going forward today?",q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
39,203,10,15,"No, sir.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
40,204,10,16,"Okay.  Great. Let's start with the date of this accident, August 19, 2017.  You were the driver of your vehicle.  Is that correct?",q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer

54,230,11,17,Yes.,q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
55,231,11,18,"Okay.  Coming across the Delaware Memorial Bridge going south into Delaware, traffic was basically stop and go, stop and go.  As I drive, I notice the car behind me would be like feet behind me.  Then he'd speed up. And how I noticed, I noticed because I was looking out my mirror and I stopped.  So I noticed that he's also looking down at I'm assuming his phone.  So when we got almost off the bridge, he would drive and stop.  As traffic inched up, he would just wait and then gun it, you know, give a lot of gas. So that's how I believe he hit the back of my car.",a,THE WITNESS,start_chat

59,259,12,21,That's correct.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
60,260,12,22,Okay.  And it happened several times until ultimately his car made contact with yours.  Is that correct?,q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer

372,1050,44,12,All right.  That's fair enough. I'm focused on a letter report that is dated April of 2018.  And Dr. Chesney talks about in the very first paragraph that he treated you following your August 2017 accident and it indicates that when you came into his office you were complaining of neck pain radiating into the right shoulder and some right ring finger stiffness. Is that consistent with your recollection of what you were feeling when you went to see Dr. Chesney initially?,q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
373,1064,45,1,"I believe, yes.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
374,1065,45,2,And do you remember a point in time or maybe even more than once having Dr. Chesney ask you questions about your medical -- strike that. Was there a point in time after you had been treating with Dr. Chesney that he had you in for an examination and asked you questions about your physical activities?,q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
375,1074,45,11,I don't recall.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
376,1075,45,12,Okay.  Did he ever talk to you and explain to you that some of your injuries may be permanent in nature?,q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
377,1078,45,15,"I don't remember him saying that. He might have, but I don't remember.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
378,1080,45,17,Okay.  That's fair enough.  Thank you. Do you ever recall having a conversation with Dr. Chesney when he tried to describe for you what injuries you sustained in the August accident versus the injuries that you sustained in the October accident?,q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
379,1089,46,1,He did say something about that. What he said I can't remember.  It's been a while.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
380,1092,46,4,"No.  That's fine.  I'm only asking -- I'm not asking you for what he knows.  I'm just asking for what you can recall, so that's a perfectly acceptable answer. Let me just look over my notes quickly.  I think that may be all the questions I have, but just give me a moment and then I'll come back on and confirm.",q,MR. NOLTE,is brackets

382,1103,46,15,"I'm back.  I've looked through my notes.  I do have one other area that I want to ask you some questions about. The MRI results that you got, once those MRI's were done and you went to see a doctor about those results -- and I'm not that sure which one it would have been -- did any of those doctors ever suggest to you that you needed to have surgery as a result of the findings on the MRI?",q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
383,1115,47,2,No.  No one mentioned anything about surgery at all.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
384,1117,47,4,And were you ever asked by any of the doctors that were treating you to go see either an orthopedic or a neurologic surgeon related to the MRI results?,q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
385,1121,47,8,Unsure.  I don't remember.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
386,1122,47,9,"Did any of your doctors that treated you, whether it was Dr. Chesney or any of the other doctors, ever talk to you about the findings, the specific findings on the MRI's?",q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
387,1127,47,14,"I think someone did.  Now what it was, I can't say.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
388,1129,47,16,Okay.  Did anyone ever suggest to you that the findings on your cervical MRI and the findings on your daughter's cervical MRI looked to be very consistent or similar?,q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
389,1134,47,21,No one talked to me about my daughter's test.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
390,1136,47,23,"So as far as you know, none of the treating physicians that you ever were seen by ever suggested to you that the results of your MRI, your cervical MRI was very similar to the results of your daughter's cervical MRI?",q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
391,1143,48,5,No.,a,THE WITNESS,start_question
392,1144,48,6,Okay.  Did it appear to you in any way that any of the doctors that were treating you changed the course of your medical care as a result of the MRI findings to either of your neck or your lumbar spine?,q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
393,1150,48,12,"As far as I know, they changed because of the two different accidents.",a,THE WITNESS,start_question
394,1152,48,14,"So, ma'am, I just want to be clear for the record.  What you indicated was they changed your care because of the two different accidents, not because of the two different diagnostic results, not the MRI's?",q,MR. NOLTE,start_answer
395,1158,48,20,Because of the accidents.,a,THE WITNESS,start_chat
